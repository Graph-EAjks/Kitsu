# Pipeline Customization

You can modify Kitsu to fit your **studio vocabulary** for the asset / Pre-production, task type, Status, etc.

You can also **add custom metadata columns** on the global page of the asset, edit, episode, sequence, and shot.

In Kitsu, you have two kinds of **libraries**:
- The first is the **Global Library** at the studio level.
Only the Studio manager has access to it.

- The second is the **Production Library**, where you will pick elements created on the global library to fill it.

The idea is to keep each production separated with a specific pipeline.


You can create and modify the department, task type, task status, asset type, and status automation on the **Global Library**.

You can create as many elements as possible, give the name you want, and choose the best color and options that fit your needs.

Once your **Global Library** is populated, you can fill the **Production Library** with the newly created element from the **Global Library**.
