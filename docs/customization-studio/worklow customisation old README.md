## Create a new Status Automation

Status automation is here to do the heavy lifting for you.

For the asset you can choose to create status automation between tasks, for exemple when concept is validated then change the modeling status as ready. But you can also create a status automation that change the asset status accoring to a task status, for example when concept is validation then the asset is ready for the storyboard.

Go to the main menu, and select **Status Automations**.

![Main menu Status Automation](../img/getting-started/main_menu_status_automation.png)

Once in the new page, you can create status automation by clicking on the **+Add status automation** button.

![create Status Automation](../img/getting-started/status_automation_empy.png)

You can choose between creating an asset automation for the **asset** or the **shot**.

Then you can choose the **task type** and the **status** that will trigger the automation.

Then you can select which task type will react to the automation and choose the status that will be changed.

![detail create status automation](../img/getting-started/add_status_automation.png)

To trigger the change of ready for status, you need to change the trigger from Status to **Ready For**.
You will notice the **Applied task type** will now display **Shot task type**..

![detail create status automation Ready For](../img/getting-started/add_status_automation_readyfor.png)

If you want to create status automation for shots, you need to change the **Entity Type** to shots.

From your production, go to the **Setting** page.
