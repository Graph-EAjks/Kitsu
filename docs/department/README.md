# Departments

## Create departments

Departments are here to help the supervisors and artists to focus on their tasks.
Once they are linked to one or several departments, supervisors and artists will have direct access to their
 filtered view, and departments also act on the permissions.

You can create as many **Departments** you need.

On the main menu ![Main menu](../img/getting-started/main_button.png) select the
