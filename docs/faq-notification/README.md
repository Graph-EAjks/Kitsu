# How to Get Notified...


## How do Notifications Work?

The notification symbol is the **Bell** button next to your name, top right of
the screen. Its color is **grey**
![Notification off](../img/getting-started/notification_icon_off.png) when you don't have
any notification, and **orange**
![Notification on](../img/getting-started/notification_icon_on.png) when you have a new
one.

When you click on the **bell** button, it opens the **notifications** page.

There, you can see all the changes made to the **tasks** you are following or
assigned to you.

![Notification page](../img/getting-started/notification_page.png)

Notifications include the following information:

* If it's a notification ![Notification page](../img/getting-started/notification_icon_comment.png) or a tag ![Notification page](../img/getting-started/notification_icon_tag.png)

* the name of the **author** ![Notification page](../img/getting-started/notification_author.png)

* the related **entity** ![Notification page](../img/getting-started/notification_entities.png)

* the related **task** ![Notification page](../img/getting-started/notification_task.png)

* the new **status** ![Notification page](../img/getting-started/wfa_icon.png)

* the **attached file** ![Notification page](../img/getting-started/notification_attached_files.png)

* and the comment.

When you click on the notification page, the comments panel on the right is displayed. You can answer directly from this page to any element.

Each part is a **link** you can use it to jump on the information you need. If
you click on the **status**, you jump to the status page of the entity. So
you can react quickly to this new change.

For example, let's give Ann a retake.

![Notification example 01](../img/getting-started/notification_example01.png)

Ann receives notification immediately, the **bell** button changes color
![Notification on](../img/getting-started/notification_icon_on.png), and she can read the
new comment.

**All the notifications and comments appear in real-time**. No need to refresh
to stay up to date.

## How to Get Notified?

As an artist, you receive a notification
![Notification](../img/getting-started/notification_icon_on.png) as soon as someone assigns you to a task, change
the status of one of your tasks, post a comment or tag you on a comment.

You can also choose to follow specific tasks. Go into the task page you want
to follow: on the **assets** or **shots** pages click onto the status icon,
then on the top right side of the page, you can see an **eye** button
![Notification off](../img/getting-started/notification_off.png).


By default, you are following all the tasks you are assigned on the task
page the icon is on (eye open) ![Notification on](../img/getting-started/notification_on.png).

If you want to follow another task, click on the **crossed eye** button
![Notification off](../img/getting-started/notification_off.png). Its aspect changes,
it is not crossed anymore ![Notification on](../img/getting-started/notification_on.png)
meaning you are now following this task and receiving notifications about
it.

You can also Batch select task to **Subscribe** to the notification of these tasks.

Select the tasks with the **Action Box**, select the eye icon, and click on subscribe.

## How to Not be Notified Anymore?

If you don't want to follow a task anymore, click on the **eye** button
![Notification on](../img/getting-started/notification_on.png) on the task page. It is crossed ![notification off](../img/getting-started/notification_off.png), meaning
you won't receive notifications anymore.


Or you can select a batch of tasks and use the **Action Box** To unsubscribe to the notification.
