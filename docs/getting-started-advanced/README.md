You can store all kinds of text information in the custom column: a **list of value**, a **free value** or a **Checklist**.

![Custom Column detail](../img/getting-started/custom_column_detail.png)

The **free value** is different for each entity.

The **list of value** and **Checklist** give you the same choice for each entity. Moreover, it has to be filled now. 

![Custom Column list](../img/getting-started/custom_column_list.png)

Type the list elements below **Available values**, and confirm them by clicking on **Add value**.

You can also link the custom column to one or several departments.


If you link a custom column to a departement, the artists will see this column on their todo page, and on their departement filtered view.

Validate the creation of the custom column with the **Confirm** button.


Back on the global spreadsheets page, you can fill this information directly on the global page.
The cases are editable.

You can click on the status of each task to open the comment panel and see the history of the comments and the different versions.


![Shot detail page](../img/getting-started/shot_detail_page_panel.png)

## Change priorities

At some point in the production, you may want to prioritize some tasks, and
pinpoint these urgent tasks to your team.

For this, we use the same technique as before. Click on the space
near a status task (1). 

![Task assigned](../img/getting-started/task_assigned.png)

The action box appears. 

![Blue menu](../img/getting-started/blue_menu.png)

Click on the icone of the action menu to choose 
**Change priority**.

![Change priority](../img/getting-started/change_priority.png)

There are four levels of priority: **Normal**, which is the fundamental level of all the
tasks, **High**, **Very High**, or **Emergency**. Save the changes with the
**Confirm** button.

As we have done for the assignation or the status, select the shots (1), select
the level of priority (2), and apply with **Confirm** (3).

![Priority selection](../img/getting-started/priority.png)

You can now see next to the status of the task some **exclamation marks**. The
more there are, the more urgent the task is.  

* (1) is **Normal**, 
* (2) is **High**,
* (3) is **Very High**
* (4) is for **Emergency**.
    
![Priority level](../img/getting-started/priority_level.png)


## Change status per batch

Alternatively, you can do it per **batch**. 

You can select multiple shots or assets by pressing the **ctrl** or
**shift** key.

Then go to the **Change status** section on the action menu.

![action menu status](../img/getting-started/blue_menu_status.png)

Choose the new status for your selected tasks (1). You can also add a comment for all the selected tasks (2)
You validate the new status with the **Confirm** button.

![Change status per batch](../img/getting-started/change_status_batch.png)


## Simplify the global page

You may need to reduce a task type column on a global page. For example, you may be 
only interested in layout and animation but not so much in the shipment for the client.

Close to each task type name, you can click on the arrow 
![Arrow](../img/getting-started/arrow.png) to unfold a submenu. 

You can choose to **Minimize** **Sort by**, **Select column**, **Stick** or **Delete All** the task type.

![Tasktype submenu minimize](../img/getting-started/tasktype_minimize.png)

Once the column is minimized, only colored dots show the status.

![Tasktype submenu](../img/getting-started/tasktype_small.png)

You can also choose which **Custom Column** you want to display.

To hide your custom column, click on the arrow on the right border of the global page.

![Visible column](../img/getting-started/visible_column.png)

Here you can choose which column you want to **hide** or **display**.

You can also hide all the non-essential columns, like **Description**, **Custom column**, 
even the minimized columns.

Just click on the **Hide additional information** 
![minimize button](../img/getting-started/minimize.png) button on the top right of the page.

To make the information reappear, click on the same button,
![maximize button](../img/getting-started/maximize.png) it won't have the grey highlight.



## Quotas stat

Kitsu has two ways to calculate the quotas per **shot Task Type**.

The first is linked to the timesheet : 
Shots are considered ended on the first feedback request. Then, quotas are weighted following time spent on the task (when the Artist filled his timesheet). 

![Quotat stat page day weighted](../img/getting-started/quotas_day_weighted.png)

In this example, Kitsu has weighted the quota per day linked to the timesheet.

![Quotat stat page day weighted detail](../img/getting-started/quotas_day_weighted_detail.png)


If no timesheet is filled, then Kitsu considers that:

The task was started at the first status change to WIP
The task was done the day the feedback request was made.
It splits the done frames among all business days between the start and the end.

Kitsu grabs the number of frames (or seconds, or number of tasks) submitted per day/week/month per Artist.

![Quotat stat page day weighted](../img/getting-started/quotas_day_status.png)




**1**: Select the Task Type

**2**: Select the level of details, Day, Week, or Month

**3**: Select the count mode, per Frame, Seconds, or tasks.

You can click on a number and see its detail on the right panel at any time.
