# Getting Started as an Artist


## First Connection

On your first connection, we encourage you to fill your contact information
into your profile.
Click on your avatar on the top right of the screen, then on **Profile**. You can also change the color of the **Theme** and hide or display the **Support Chat**.

NB: A link to this **Documentation** and YouTube **Tutorials** are available .
You can also jump on our Discord or look at our roadmap.

![User profile](../img/getting-started/user_profil.png)

On this new page, you can check your name , your email (3), fill your phone
number (4), change the timezone (5), the language of the website (6), and
post a pic of yourself as your avatar (7). It helps to recognize who is
doing what!

![User detail](../img/getting-started/user_profil1.png)

You can also define what kind of notification you want, email or slack.

![User detail](../img/getting-started/user_profil2.png)


If you keep scrolling, you can also change your password if you want. We
encourage you to change the default password with one of your own.

![User password](../img/getting-started/user_password.png)


## See your Assignments

The central part for you, on **Kitsu**, is the **My tasks** page.
It's the first landing page when you log in.


You can see per **Production** (1) the **Entity** (2) you are assigned to, but also the **Estimation** time (3), and the **Duration** (4) you already spend, the **Due date** (5), the
**Status** (6) of the tasks you are working on and their **priority** (7).

![My tasks page](../img/getting-started/my_task_page.png)

You can sort your page by **name**, **priority**, **status**, **estimation** or **last comment**.

![My tasks page](../img/getting-started/mytask_sort.png)

You can also filter your tasks.

![My tasks page](../img/getting-started/mytask_filter.png)


Besides the shortcut **My Tasks** on top of the screen, you can also find it on the main menu ![Main menu](../img/getting-started/main_button.png),
under the **User** section of **MY TASKS**. The Kitsu logo is a shortcut too
to your task list.

![My tasks](../img/getting-started/my_tasks.png)




## Share your Progress

When you start a new task you are assigned to, click on the Status![Todo](../img/getting-started/todo_icon.png)
(1) on your my task page. You can also do it on the shots or assets page.

![Shot status](../img/getting-started/my_task_status.png)

It opens a panel on the right of the screen, where you can communicate about your work. Let your teammates know what you are doing.
For instance, show them you start working on something.
Each time you change the status of a task, you can attach a
text comment to it.

For example, when you start a **new task**, you can say that everything is ok.
If some information is missing, you can either ask all the questions you want.

To change the Status, let's say from ![Todo](../img/getting-started/todo_icon.png) to ![Wip](../img/getting-started/wip_icon.png) as an example,select the **Change status** tab,
type your comment. Then, click on the status box, choose the
one you want.

And validate your comment and the new Status by clicking on
**Post**  button.

![Changing status](../img/getting-started/changing_status.png)

You can edit your last comment by clicking on the "history" button and then
using the **edit** button
![Edit button](../img/getting-started/edit_button.png).


## Ask for a Review

You can ask for a review by switching the tab to **Publish revision**
and change the Status of a task to
(**Waiting for Approval** ![wfa](../img/getting-started/wfa_icon.png)).

You can drag and drop your file directly or click on the **Attach preview** button.

![Add preview file](../img/getting-started/add_preview.png)

![Waiting for approval](../img/getting-started/wfa_status.png)

Then use the **Post** button.

Your work appears on the right part of the screen as a V1.

![Preview v1](../img/getting-started/previewv1.png)

If you post several revisions, you always keep track of your previous work.
Each time you add a new revision, the previous versions are still available.

![Preview v2](../img/getting-started/previewv2.png)

You can add multiple images simultaneously, or once you have uploaded an image, you can add another one.

![attach preview drag drop](../img/getting-started/upload_several_pictures.png)

The **Add preview** popup opens and asks you to choose a file.

You can navigate through the pictures uploaded.

![attach preview drag drop](../img/getting-started/upload_second_pictures.png)


This detailed page of the tasks is your way to communicate with others.
They also use this page to answer your questions, give you feedback, and ask for a retake. The history of the conversation is always available.

For quicker access to the information, when you get back to your todo
page, the last comment posted on each task is available too.

![My tasks page](../img/getting-started/my_task_page2.png)

You can also see the tasks validated as ![Validated](../img/getting-started/done_icon.png) and the discard tasks as ![NA](../img/getting-started/na_icon.png)
on the **Done** tab.

![My done tasks page](../img/getting-started/done_page.png)

## Fill your Timesheet

Every day, you can declare how much time you spent on each task. On your **My Tasks**
page, go to the **Timesheets** tab (1). Or click on the shortcut on top of the screen.

![Timesheets](../img/getting-started/timesheets.png)

You need to move the cursor (3) next to each task accordingly to the number of
hours spent. You can also go quicker and click on the **1**, **4**, or **8**
hours buttons (4).

If you miss your declaration one day, you can click on the today date (2) and
go back in time and select the day you have missed. If you didn't work, you could tag the day as a **Day Off** (5).

![Timesheets change the date](../img/getting-started/timesheet_change_date.png)

In case you forget to mention the time spent on a finished task, you can still
find it in the **Done tasks** list located below the running tasks list.
