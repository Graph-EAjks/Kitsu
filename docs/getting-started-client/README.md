The central part for you, on **Kitsu**, is the **Playlist** page.
You can access it by clicking on the production avatar.

## Production report

To ease the communication with the studio, you have direct access to the production report, separated into two parts: the **Sequence Stats** and the **Asset Types Stats**

![Client dropdown menu sequence stat](../img/getting-started/client_dropdown_sequence.png)

The **Sequence Stats** page is updated in real-time. Every time you look at this page, you are sure to have updated information.

![Client sequence stat](../img/getting-started/client_sequence_stat.png)

You can choose to display the stats per number of shots or number of frames.

You can also change the **Display Mode**; you can switch from the **Pie charts** view
to the **Counts** view.

It's this presentation that you can download to keep track of the production progress.
