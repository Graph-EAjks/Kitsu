# Client Playlists

## Create a Playlist for your Client


You can find the **Playlists** page on the drop-down menu.

![Playlist main menu](../img/getting-started/drop_down_menu_playlist.png)

The **playlist** page is separated into two parts:

- (1) The playlist list where you can **create** a playlist or load an existing one.
- (2) The last created playlists and the last modified playlists

![Playlist page](../img/getting-started/playlist_page.png)

Start by creating a **Playlist**
![Playlist add button](../img/getting-started/playlist_add_button.png). 


Your default name
is the date and the hour. You can change it immediately. 


You need to select the playlist shared with **The Client** and whether it's an  **Assets**, **Shots**, or **Sequences** playlist.
You can also add a **Task Type** tag to the playlist.

![Playlist add page](../img/getting-started/playlist_add_page_client.png)

Once the playlist is created, via the search/filter bar, you can select which shots to add
to your playlist.

::: tip
 Kitsu will automatically load **the latest uploaded version** of the task type.

You can also choose to **add the whole movie**, and it will add all the shots of the movie.

![Playlist page](../img/getting-started/playlist_example_client.png)

Otherwise, you can **Add the whole sequence** if you want to focus only on a particular sequence.

You can use the same **filter** than on the global shot/asset page. For example, you can select all the
**Done** tasks for the render stage.
You can type your research **render=done** in the search bar or use the filter builder button. 

Valid your selection with the **Add selection** button.


Kitsu will select the shots with the **Done** status at the **Compositing** stage.


The shots appear on the top part of the screen. Every change are
automatically saved.
