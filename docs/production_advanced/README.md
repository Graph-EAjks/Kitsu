# Create a Production - Advanced

## Create Tasks for Episode

In a TV Show production, you can create a specific **Task type** for the episode. It's especially useful when
you have macro tasks to track, like the script, SFx, editing, mix, etc.

To use this page, you need to first create a dedicated task type on your **Global Library**
 with the **Episode** attribute.

See **Pipeline customization** Section to create a new **Task Type**.

[Pipeline customization](../customization-pipeline/README.md)


Once you have created your **Task Types**  on your **Global Library**, add them to your
**Production Library**, you will see the **Episodes** displayed on the navigation drop-down menu.


![Navigation Episodes](../img/getting-started/drop_down_menu_episodes.png)


This new page behaves like the asset and shot global page. You can add your tasks with the
![Add Tasks](../img/getting-started/add_task_button.png) button.

You can add a custom metadata column, fill in the description, etc.




You can **Rename** and **Delete** the Episodes entity on this page, as for the asset and shot entity.

If you click on the name of an episode, you will see the detail page of this episode.

## Create Tasks for Sequence

When you are in a production, you can create specific **Task type** for the sequences. It's especially useful when
you have macro tasks to track, like Story and color Board, Color Grading, etc.

## Create Tasks for Edit

In a production, you can create a specific **Task type** for the Edit. It's especially useful when
you have several to track, like Story and color Board, Color Grading, etc.

To use this page, you need to first create a dedicated task type on your **Global Library**
 with the **Edit** attribute.

## Create Custom Metadata Columns

To add more information on the general spreadsheet pages, you must create a custom **metadata column**.


Click on the **+** near the Name column.

![Metadata Column](../img/getting-started/add_column_custom.png)

You may have extra information to add on your pages as the **level of difficulties**,
the **name of the studios**, when a production is split, the shot order, etc.

You can store all kinds of text information in the custom metadata column:
a free **text**, a **number**, a **checkbox**, a **list of value**, or a **Checklist**.

![Metadata Column detail](../img/getting-started/custom_column_detail.png)

The **text**, **number**, and **checkbox** fields differ for each entity.

The **list of value** and **Checklist** give you the same choice for each entity. Moreover, it has to be filled now.

![Metadata Column list](../img/getting-started/custom_column_list.png)

Type the list elements below **Available values**, and confirm them by clicking on **Add value**.

You can also link the metadata column to one or several departments.


If you link a metadata column to a department, the artists will see it on their to-do page and department-filtered view.

Validate the creation of the metadata column with the **Confirm** button.


Back on the global spreadsheets page, you can fill in this information directly on the global page.
The cases are editable.

![Metadata Column detail](../img/getting-started/custom_column_list_edit.png)

You can also modify the information with the edit button ![Edit button](../img/getting-started/edit_button.png).

You now see a new line on the edit pop-up. You can select the information from the list,
alternatively, enter the free text or number, check a box, or use the checklist, depending on your previous choice.

Don't forget to press the **Confirm** button when you are done.

![Metadata Column detail](../img/getting-started/edit_asset_custom.png)

If you need to **edit** or **delete** the metadata column, go back to the general spreadsheet page.
Nearby the name of your metadata column, click on the arrow![Metadata Column detail](../img/getting-started/arrow.png).

You can now **sort** your global page with this new column. For example, let's create a **Sort Order** metadata column.

![Metadata Column example](../img/getting-started/custom_column_exemple.png)

Then click the arrow on the right of the column name to open his menu. Then click on **Sort By**

![Metadata Column Sort By](../img/getting-started/custom_column_sortby.png)

The shots are not sorted by name but by the metadata column information.

![Metadata Column Sort By result](../img/getting-started/custom_column_sortby_result.png)

You can also select in the menu if you want to edit the name of the metadata column and its information or if you want to delete it.

You can also use the **CSV Import** to quickly fill your custom metadata column.
First, you must create your **Metadata column** into Kitsu, add it to your spreadsheet, and copy-paste your data into the **CSV Import**.

[Update Shots information with CSV Import](../batch-action/README.md#update-shots-information-with-csv-import)


## Add Multiple Previews as one Version

You can add multiple images simultaneously, or once you have uploaded an image, you can add another one.

## Change Priorities

At some point in the production, you may want to prioritize some tasks, and
pinpoint these urgent tasks to your team.

For this, we use the same technique as before. Click on the space
near a status task (1).

![Task assigned](../img/getting-started/task_assigned.png)

The action box appears.

![Blue menu](../img/getting-started/blue_menu.png)

Click on the icon of the action menu to choose
**Change priority**.

![Change priority](../img/getting-started/change_priority.png)

There are four levels of priority: **Normal**, which is the fundamental level of all the
tasks **High**, **Very High**, or **Emergency**. Save the changes with the
**Confirm** button.

As we have done for the assignation or the status, select the shots (1), select
the level of priority (2), and apply with **Confirm** (3).

![Priority selection](../img/getting-started/priority.png)

You can now see next to the status of the task some **exclamation marks**. The
more there are, the more urgent the task is.

* (1) is **Normal**,
* (2) is **High**,
* (3) is **Very High**
* (4) is for **Emergency**.

![Priority level](../img/getting-started/priority_level.png)


## Change Status per Batch

Alternatively, you can do it per **batch**.

You can select multiple shots or assets by pressing the **ctrl** or
**shift** key.

Then go to the **Change status** section on the action menu.

![action menu status](../img/getting-started/blue_menu_status.png)

Choose the new status for your selected tasks (1). You can also add a comment for all the selected tasks (2)
You validate the new status with the **Confirm** button.

![Change status per batch](../img/getting-started/change_status_batch.png)


## Simplify the Global Page

You may need to reduce a task type column on a global page. For example, you may be
only interested in layout and animation but not so much in the shipment for the client.

Close to each task type name, you can click on the arrow
![arrow](../img/getting-started/arrow.png) to unfold a submenu.

You can choose to **Minimize** **Sort by**, **Select column**, **Stick**, or **Delete All** the task type.

![Tasktype submenu minimize](../img/getting-started/tasktype_minimize.png)

Once the column is minimized, only colored dots show the status.

![Tasktype submenu](../img/getting-started/tasktype_small.png)

You can also choose which **Metadata column** you want to display.

To hide your metadata column, click on the arrow on the right border of the global page.

![Visible column](../img/getting-started/visible_column.png)

You can choose which column you want to **hide** or **display**.

You can also hide all the non-essential columns, like **Description**, **Metadata column**,
even the minimized columns.

Just click on the **Hide additional information**
![minimize button](../img/getting-started/minimize.png) button on the top right of the page.

To make the information reappear, click on the same button,
![maximize button](../img/getting-started/maximize.png) it won't have the grey highlight.


## Sticky Columns

If a piece of information is very important to you, you can **Stick** this column next to the shot name.

It can be a **Task Type** column or a **Meta Data** column.

Click on the arrow on the left of the column to open the column menu, then choose **Stick**.

![Stick Option Menu](../img/getting-started/stick_option_menu.png)

Once a column is stuck, it will stay displayed even if the page is simplified.

![Stick column simplified](../img/getting-started/stick_simplified.png)
