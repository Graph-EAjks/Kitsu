# Review

## Perform a Review

When an artist needs someone to **review** their work, they can change the status of their task to ![wfa](../img/getting-started/wfa_icon.png).

Click on the status to open the right hand panel and start the review.

You can watch the version from the right panel, enlarge it by grabbing the side of the panel, or even enter fullscreen by clicking this icon ![Fullscreen](../img/getting-started/fullscreen.png).

![review on global page](../img/getting-started/review_global.png)

In the same way, you can also review 3D files (`.glb` file) as a wireframe or add a `.HDR` file to check the lighting.

You can move around the 3D file by dragging and dropping your cursor and zooming in or out with the scroll wheel.

See the **Customization** section for more details.
[Pipeline Customization](../customization-pipeline/README.md)
<!-- Dead link, need to confirm where this goes to -->

You can select a color to use and then draw directly on the preview with the **Pencil** tool ![Pencil](../img/getting-started/draw.png).

![review drawing](../img/getting-started/review_comment.png)

You can also annotate the frame with **text**.

![review drawing text](../img/getting-started/review_comment_text.png)

If you'd like to temporarily **hide annotations**, click the **Fountain Pen** button.
![Hide Annotation](../img/getting-started/hide_annotation.png)

If you would like to refer back to a specific frame in your comments, you can easily tag a frame by typing `@`, which opens a sub-menu with the team list, and then start typing **frame**.

This will then add a timestamp of the current frame to this comment, and clicking on that timestamp will jump to said frame.

![Tag a frame](../img/getting-started/tag_frame.png)

You can also export your drawings on each frame by attaching the **screenshots as attachments**.

Click on the **Add attachment** button.

![attachment](../img/getting-started/attachment_retake.png)

You can also choose to **Attach snapshots from your annotation** in the attachment options. This lets you take annotated frames and add them as attachments of the comment, which can be useful if you want to highlight specific annotations in your feedback.

![Attachment snapshot](../img/getting-started/screenshot_attachment.png)

Once you click the button, Kitsu will grab all the frames with annotations and display the result. You can publish them with **Confirm**.

![Attachment snapshot detail](../img/getting-started/attachment_snapshot_detail.png)

If you need to delete a line, click the pencil icon again. The cursor changes to a multi-directional cross ![Pencil](../img/getting-started/direction_arrow.png), and you can then select your line and move it around.

<!-- Need to test this, couldn't get this to work -->

![review drawing](../img/getting-started/review_edit.png)

Select the line with the directional cross, then press the **delete** icon ![Delete line](../img/getting-started/delete_line.png).

By entering **Full-Screen**, you can compare two task types or versions side by side by clicking on the **Compare** button ![compare button](../img/getting-started/compare_button.png).

![compare button](../img/getting-started/compare_version.png)

From here, you can change the status to ![Retake](../img/getting-started/retake_icon.png) if you want the artist to make changes.

Alternatively, you can change it to ![Done](../img/getting-started/done_icon.png) to notify the artist that their work is approved.

## Review a Concept

Once your artists upload a concept, you can review it with the supervisor or the director.

To review the concept, use the navigation menu at the top of the screen and select the concept page.

![Menu concept](../img/getting-started/menu_concept.png)

You can see all the uploaded concepts, their statuses, assignments, and linked assets.

![Concept filled status](../img/getting-started/concept_empty_prod_linked.png)

To review a concept, click on the status to open the comment panel. You can enlarge the comment panel or go fullscreen.

Then, proceed to write a comment, select the status **Approved** or **Rejected**, and confirm with the **Post** button.

![Concept status comment](../img/getting-started/concept_status_comment.png)

You can filter the page with the **Status** filter to display all the concepts with a **Neutral** status. You can also filter by artist and change the sort order.

## Playlists

### Create a Playlist

A playlist is list of curated versions / previews compiled for review and approval. You can find the **Playlists** page in the drop-down menu.

![Playlist main menu](../img/getting-started/drop_down_menu_playlist.png)

The **Playlist** page is separated into two parts:

- (1) A list of your playlists where you can **create** a news ones or load an existing one.
- (2) The last created playlists and the last modified playlists.

![Playlist page](../img/getting-started/playlist_page.png)

Start by creating a **Playlist** using the ![Playlist add button](../img/getting-started/playlist_add_button.png) button. The playlist name defaults to the current date & time, but you can change this. You can choose if the playlist will be shared with the **studio** or the **client** and if it's a **shot** or **asset** playlist. You can also add a **Task Type** tag to the playlist.

![Playlist add page](../img/getting-started/playlist_add_page.png)

Once the playlist is created, use the search/filter bar to select which shots to add to your playlist.

You will also see options for adding the an **entire episode** / **entire sequence** if you want to add large chunks of the project at once.

You can select **Daily pending**, which will add all the **WFA** tasks of the day.

You can use the same **filters** as the global shot/asset page. For example, you can select all the **WFA** (short for "work for animation") tasks at the **Animation** stage by typing **animation=wfa** in the search bar. Validate your selection with the **Add selection** button. Kitsu will select the shots with the **WFA** status at the **Animation** stage and automatically load the **latest uploaded version**.

The shots appear in the top part of the screen. Every change is automatically saved.

![Playlist task selection](../img/getting-started/playlist_task_selection.png)
![Playlist version selection](../img/getting-started/playlist_version_selection.png)

You can also play two tasks of a shot side by side.

Click on the **Compare** button ![Compare button](../img/getting-started/compare_button.png) and choose the second task type.

![Playlist side by side](../img/getting-started/playlist_side_by_side.png)

You can comment on the shots directly from the preview.

Click on the **comment** button.



![Playlist comment](../img/getting-started/playlist_comment_button.png)

You now have access to the right panel, which shows a history of the comments and their statuses.

You can see the drawing comment on the video (the red dot below the timeline).

![Playlist comment](../img/getting-started/playlist_comment.png)

You can draw or type on the video (similar to [Perform a review](../getting-started-production/README.md#perform-a-review)) using the **draw** button ![draw button](../img/getting-started/draw.png).

## Review Room

The Review Room is a collaborative space designed for efficient and synchronized dailies review sessions. It ensures that all participants are viewing the same content simultaneously, facilitating real-time feedback and discussion.

You can join the **Review Room** by clicking the button at the top of the playlist. The review room will synchronize all the participants.

Everyone in the review room will see the play, pause, shot, and frame selections in real-time.

Additionally, the Review Room supports synchronized drawing annotations. This feature allows participants to draw directly on the frames being reviewed, with all annotations visible to everyone in the session. This capability enhances communication and clarity, making it easier to point out specific details, suggest changes, and highlight important aspects of the work.
