# Review

## Perform a Review

When an artist needs a **review**, he changes the status of their task, too ![wfa](../img/getting-started/wfa_icon.png).

Click on status to open the right panel and start the review.

You can watch the version from the right panel, enlarge it by grabbing the side of the panel, or even go fullscreen ![Fullscreen](../img/getting-started/fullscreen.png).

![review on global page](../img/getting-started/review_global.png)

You can also review the 3D file (`.glb` file) as a wireframe or add a `.HDR` file to check the lighting. 

You can move around the 3D file by dragging and dropping your cursor and zooming in or out with the scroll.

You can draw directly on the preview with the **Pencil** tool and select a color ![Pencil](../img/getting-started/draw.png).

You can also add **text** on the frame.

If you need to see the preview without your comment, **hide your annotation**, you can click on the **Fountain Pen** button.
![Hide Annotation](../img/getting-started/hide_annotation.png)


You can tag a frame (whatever version you are in), type the `@`and it opens a sub-menu with the team list, and start typing **frame**.

You can also export your drawings on each frame by attaching the **screenshots as attachments**.

Click on the **Add attachment** button.

![attachment](../img/getting-started/attachment_retake.png)

You can also choose to **Attach snapshots from your annotation** on the attachment option.

![Attachment snapshot](../img/getting-started/screenshot_attachment.png)

Once you click the button, Kitsu will grab all the frames with annotation and display the result. You can publish them with **Confirm**.

![Attachment snapshot detail](../img/getting-started/attachment_snapshot_detail.png)


If you need to delete your line, click the pencil icon again. The cursor changes to a multi-directional cross![Pencil](../img/getting-started/direction_arrow.png), and then you can select your line and move it around.

![review drawing](../img/getting-started/review_edit.png)

Select the line with the directional cross, then press the **delete** icon ![Delete line](../img/getting-started/delete_line.png)


If you go into **Full-Screen**, you can compare two task types or versions side by side when you click on the **Compare** button
![compare button](../img/getting-started/compare_button.png).

![compare button](../img/getting-started/compare_version.png)

From there, you can change the status too![Retake](../img/getting-started/retake_icon.png) if you want the Artist to perform some changes.


Alternatively, you can change it to ![Done](../img/getting-started/done_icon.png) to notify the Artist that their work is validated.


## Review a Concept

Once your artists upload the concept, you can review it with the supervisor or the director.

To review the concept, you use the navigation menu at the top of the screen and select the concept page.

![Menu concept](../img/getting-started/menu_concept.png)

You can see all the concepts uploaded and the status, assignation, and linked assets.

To review a concept, click the status part to open the comment panel. You can enlarge the comment panel or go fullscreen.

Then, write a comment, select the status **Approved** or **Rejected**, and validate with the **Post** button.

You can filter the page with the **Status** filter to display all the **Neutral** status concepts.

## Playlists

## Create a Playlist


You can find the **Playlists** page on the drop-down menu.

![Playlist main menu](../img/getting-started/drop_down_menu_playlist.png)

The **playlist** page is separated into two parts:

- (1) The playlist list where you can **create** a playlist or load an existing one.
- (2) The last created playlists and the last modified playlists

![Playlist page](../img/getting-started/playlist_page.png)

Start by creating a **Playlist**
![Playlist add button](../img/getting-started/playlist_add_button.png). Your default name
is the date and the hour. You can change it immediately. You can choose if the playlist
will be shared with the **studio** or the **client** and if it's a **shot** or **asset** playlist.
You can also add a **Task Type** tag to the playlist.

![Playlist add page](../img/getting-started/playlist_add_page.png)

Once the playlist is created, via the search/filter bar, you can select which shots to add
to your playlist.

You can also choose to **add the whole movie**, and it will add all the shots of the movie.

You can select **Daily pending**, which will add all the **WFA** tasks of the day.

Otherwise, you can **Add the whole sequence** if you want to focus only on a particular sequence.

You can use the same **filter** than on the global shot/asset page. For example, you can select all the
WFA is short for the animation stage.
You have to type **animation=wfa** in the search bar. Valid your selection with the **Add selection** button.
Kitsu will select the shots with the **WFA** status at the **Animation** stage. Still, Kitsu will automatically load **the latest uploaded version**.

The shots appear on the top part of the screen. Every change are
automatically saved.
