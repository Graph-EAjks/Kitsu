# Create an ASSET-only Production

Now that you have designed your workflow in Kitsu and invited more people, it's time to create your production. 

Click on the **Create a new
production** button.

![Create a production](../img/getting-started/create_production.png)

Enter your production name, and choose **only Asset** as the **type**, then select the style of your production (2D, 3D).


Then, you must fill in technical information, such as the number of FPS, the Ration, and the Resolution.

All these data will be used when Kitsu re-encodes the video previews uploaded.

Then, you need to define your production's start and end dates.

![Add a production](../img/getting-started/add_production.png)

You can define your production workflow in the next part, 3 to 6.



You need to select your asset task type (3), task status (4), and asset types (5).

![Add a production Pipeline](../img/getting-started/add_production_pipe.png)


::: tip
To create your **Production Workflow**, you will select Task Types from the Global Library.

If you realize you missed some Task Types, you will be able to create them later.

See the [Studio Workflow](../configure-kitsu/README.md#studio-workflows) section.
:::

Then, 6 is the option part. If you already have a spreadsheet with your Asset.

See the **import CSV** section for more details.

[Import asset](../short-asset/README.md#create-an-asset)

Validate everything with the ![All done](../img/getting-started/all_done_go.png) button.






## Introduction to the Kitsu Global Page



Welcome to Kitsu's global asset page.

Let's take a look around.

![Presentation of the global page](../img/getting-started/presentation_global.png)

On the top part (1), you have the **global navigation**, which is always visible throughout all the production pages.

**From left to right:**


### Main Menu

By clicking on the top left button, Kitsu![Main menu button](../img/getting-started/main_button.png) (or your Studio logo), you will open the Main Menu.

On the Main Menu, you will find direct access to your assigned tasks, productions, global and team schedules, the workflow customization page, and the Kitsu settings.

::: details Main Menu Details
**WORKSPACE**
- My Tasks: your assigned tasks

- Settings
- Logs

::: warning Permission Visibility
The WORKSPACE section is enabled for all permissions except My Checks, which artists do not see.

Artist (and above) can also see their own **Timesheets**, and have access to the **Entity Search**
:::

### Navigation

You will see the navigation dropdown menu on the right of the main menu icon.

![Presentation of the global page](../img/getting-started/presentation_global_header.png)


You can choose between production. The name of the actual production and actual page are always displayed.

You can use the dropdown menu to navigate from production to production (if you have several).

Once you have selected a production, the next dropdown menu will help you navigate through the different pages of this production.


::: details Navigation details
The first section is about the tracking of your tasks
- Assets
- Edits (If you have created specific tasks)

The second section is more about the side of the production
- Concepts
- Breakdown
- Playlists
- News feed

The third section is about statistics
- Asset Type Stats

The fourth section is related to Team Management
- Schedule
- Quotas
- Team

The fifth section is about the settings of your production
- Settings

::: tip
You start with the asset page, but you can change your production homepage to other entities (see setting page)
:::

::: warning 
If you realize you need an extra level of navigation, such as **Episodes**, you need to change your production Type to a **TV Show**.

If, on the contrary, you realize you need the **shots**, you also need to switch your production type from **Only Assets** to **Short**.
:::

### Global Search, News, Notification and Documentation
You have the global search on the right of the navigation dropdown menu. It's a quick access search that will display the four first results. If you need more results and filtering options, see the **Entity Search** page.


The next icon ![News](../img/getting-started/canny.png) is a direct link to our news and feedback page. 

You can see all the new features with an animated gif and also add suggestions about the next feature you want to see in Kitsu.

Next, the bell icon ![Notification](../img/getting-started/notification_icon_on.png) displays your notifications (assignments, comments, tags). The number of unread notifications will be shown on the bell icon. There are various filters to help you stay on top of updates and revisit important ones when needed. You can easily mark notifications as read or unread or quickly filter by watching/non-watching to focus on what matters most and declutter your feed.

The last icon before your avatar is the documentation button.
![documentation button](../img/getting-started/documentation_button.png), that you are reading right now!


### Personal Settings
You can click on your avatar to open your menu (setting, documentation, etc.).

![Profile enlarged](../img/getting-started/profil_enlarge.png).

## The Tasks Spreadsheet

### Entity spreadsheet

The second part of the screen is common to all the entities (Asset, shot, sequence, Edit). This is the global tasks spreadsheet.

Here, you see the status, assignation, priority, etc, for each task.

::: tip
The first line and column header of the spreadsheet always appear at the top of the page, even if you scroll down.

You can also **Stick** other columns to keep them visible at all times.
:::

### Filters

The first element on the left is the filter box. You can type anything you want for simple filtering, sequence, asset type, etc.

If you need more advanced filtering, please use the filter builder button.

![Filter Builder](../img/getting-started/filter_builder.png)

You can then save all the filters and use them as your pages.

### Simplify the display

On the right part of the screen, there are some buttons (from left to right) to hide or display the assignation, hide or display the extra column, enlarge or reduce the thumbnail,
![display and Hide option](../img/getting-started/display_hide_option.png)


### Import / Export
batch import thumbnail ![batch import thumbnail](../img/getting-started/add_thumbnails.png), and finally import ![Import button](../img/getting-started/import.png) or export ![export button](../img/getting-started/export.png) data.



### Metadata column
Below, you have the name of the column. the (+) next to **Name** ![Add metadata column](../img/getting-started/add_column_custom.png) is here to create a new metadata column. Then, you have the name of the task type column.

### Customize the view
On the far right of the screen, next to the scroll bar, is the option to hide and display a text column

![Display/hide text column](../img/getting-started/visible_column_detail.png).


### Sum-up of your view
The last part (4), at the bottom of the screen, is the sum-up of your displayed page. It means the sum-up will update if you filter the page.

You can see the number of elements (assets or shots), the total number of estimated days, and the total number of days already spent.



## Create an Asset
### Create your first Asset
So, now that we have created our production and have a general grasp of the Kitsu interface, it's time to create our very first Asset.

On the asset page, click on **Add assets**.

![Asset page first time](../img/getting-started/add_assets_first.png)

::: warning
When you create an asset, your task workflow will be applied, and **all the tasks will be created simultaneously as the Asset**.
:::

A pop-up window opens:

It asks you to choose the **Asset Type** (1).
If you didn't add a new asset type, Kitsu will provide you with examples such as Characters, Environment, FX, Props, etc. 
Let's start with a character.

::: tip
You can also customize the asset type list and the tasks pipeline.
[Customization of the workflow](../customization-pipeline/README.md#modify-an-existing-asset-types) )
:::

We give it a **Name** (2) and enter a description that helps the Artist know what to do and quickly identify the Asset.

Click on **Confirm and stay** if you have multiple assets to create.


![Create an asset](../img/getting-started/add_asset_popup.png)

You can change the asset type and keep adding assets.

::: tip
The newly created Asset appears in the background whenever you click on **Confirm and stay**.
:::

After adding your last Asset, click
on **Confirm**. It will create the Asset and close the window. 

::: tip
If you click on **Confirm and stay ** but realize you don't have more assets to add, click on **Close**, and the winwill bew is canceled.
:::

![Global asset page](../img/getting-started/asset_edit.png)

You will also see the tasks that are selected for your assets workflow are created at the same time.


If you need to add more **Assets**, click the **+ Create assets** button.

::: details Create Assets from a CSV Spreadsheet File
You may already have your asset list ready in a spreadsheet file.
With Kitsu, you have two ways to import them; the first is to import a `.csv` file and copy-paste your data directly into Kitsu.

First, save your spreadsheet as a `.csv` file.

Then, go back to the asset page on Kitsu and click on the **Import** icon.
![Import Icon](../img/getting-started/import.png)

And the **Timelog** if people have filled out their timesheet on the tasks of this Asset.

![Asset detail casting](../img/getting-started/asset_detail_page_timelog.png)



## Add more tasks after creating the assets


If you realize **after** creating the assets that the task is missing, you can still add them.

First, be sure that the missing task type is added to the settings page under the task type tab.

Then go back to the asset page and click on **+ Add tasks**






 ### Update your assets
At any point, you can update your assets, change their name and asset type, modify their description, and any custom information you added to the global page.

You can edit assets by going to the asset page, hovering over the Asset you want to modify, and then clicking on the **edit** button
![Edit button](../img/getting-started/edit_button.png) (1) on the right side of
the line.

## Create a Concept
### Upload a Concept

To create a **Concept**, go to the **Concept** page with the navigation menu.

![Concept Menu](../img/getting-started/menu_concept.png)

To upload a concept, click the **Add a new reference to concepts** button.

You can upload one or several concepts at the same time.

![Concept empty page](../img/getting-started/concept_empty_prod.png)

Once you upload your previews, the concept page will look like this.

![Concept filled page](../img/getting-started/concept_filled_prod.png)


You can interact with the concept in two ways: click on the picture to see an enlarged view.
The second is to click on the status part to open the **Comment Panel** on the right.

On the comment panel, you have two options: link a concept to an existing asset or delete it.
You can also comment and change the status of the Asset.

The idea is to have one version per **Concept**. If it's not approved, you need to upload a new concept, not to have multiple versions of the same concept.

One concept is one task.


![Concept options](../img/getting-started/concept_options.png)


### Link a Concept to an Asset

Once concepts are uploaded, you can link them to the assets.

You can see the links on the status part of the assets.

Click on the status part of the concept; it will open the comment panel on the right.

![Concept Comment Panel](../img/getting-started/concept_comment_panel.png)

On the comment panel, you have two options at the top: Link a concept to an asset and delete the concept.

To link an asset, click on the **Link** ![Link button](../img/getting-started/link_icon.png) button.

Kitsu will display all the **Assets** available to link with the concept uploaded.

Kitsu will list the linked assets at the top of the comment panel. For now, there are No Links.


![Concept link](../img/getting-started/concept_link.png)

To link an asset, you have to click on it. The linked assets' names will appear at the top of the screen and under the preview of the concept.


![Concept asset linked](../img/getting-started/concept_asset_linked.png)

Once a concept is linked to an asset, it can be seen on the asset's detail page.

Return to the asset page, and click on the asset name you want to see the concept.

![Detail asset page](../img/getting-started/asset_detail_page.png)

Per default, the casting detail is displayed on the second part of the screen. 
Use the dropdown menu to choose the concept.

![asset detail concept](../img/getting-started/asset_detail_concept.png)

Once in the concept section, you will see all the concepts created for this Asset. You can filter them per status.

![asset detail concept list](../img/getting-started/asset_detail_concep_listt.png)



## Create Custom Metadata Columns

To add more information on the general spreadsheet pages, you must create a custom **metadata column**.

You may have extra information to add to your pages, such as the **level of difficulties**, **Weather**, **Tag**, etc. You can store all text (or number) information in the custom metadata column.


Click on the **+** near the Name column.

![Metadata Column](../img/getting-started/add_column_custom.png)



With the **Type** option, you can choose how you want to store your information:
- a free **Text**, 
- a **Number**, 
- a **Checkbox**, 
- a **List of value**,
- a **List of tags**,
- a **Checklist**.

![Metadata Column detail](../img/getting-started/custom_column_detail.png)

::: warning 
The **Text**, **Number**, and **Checkbox** allow you to add different information for each entity. You don't have to plan it first.

The **List of value**, **List of tags**, and **Checklist** give you the same choice for each entity. Moreover, it has to be filled now.

![Metadata Column list](../img/getting-started/custom_column_list.png)

Type the list elements below **Available values**, and confirm them by clicking on **Add value**.
:::

You can also link the **metadata column** to one or several **departments**.

::: tip
Link a metadata column to a department. The artists/supervisors will see it on their to-do page and in the department-filtered view.

You can link the metadata column to one or more departments. Click on the department from the list and then click on **add** to be effective.

Here, the VFX column is linked to two departments.

![Department metadata column filtered view](../img/getting-started/department_filtered_view_column.png)

:::

::: details Edit meta column
On the global page of the Asset or the shot, click on the arrow to the right of your metadata column and click on **Edit**.

![Metadata column Edit](../img/getting-started/custom_column_edit.png)
:::


You can fill in this information directly on the global spreadsheets page.
The cases are editable.

![Metadata Column detail](../img/getting-started/custom_column_list_edit.png)

::: tip
You can batch-modify the metadata column by selecting several entities on the left and then modifying your metadata column.
:::

::: details Edit by hand
You can also modify the information with the edit button ![Edit button](../img/getting-started/edit_button.png).

You now see a new line on the edit pop-up. You can select the information from the list,
alternatively, enter the free text or number, check a box, or use the checklist, depending on your previous choice.

Remember to press the **Confirm** button when you are done.

![Metadata Column detail](../img/getting-started/edit_asset_custom.png)
:::

Go to the general spreadsheet page if you need to edit or delete the metadata column.
Nearby the name of your metadata column, click on the arrow ![Metadata Column detail](../img/getting-started/arrow.png).

::: tip
You can **sort** your global page with this new column. Click the arrow on the right of the column name to open his menu. Then click on **Sort By**.

You can also **Stick** the metadata column to the left.
:::

## Create an Edit

You can track tasks at the **Edit** Level in Kitsu.

It's especially useful when
You have several edits to track through several validation steps. For example, you can track your whole movie, several trailers, and the First Edit, Fine Edit, Mix, etc.

::: warning
Per default, the **Edit** page will not be displayed until you have task types for it on your **production library** (setting page)
:::



To use this page, you need to first create a dedicated task type on your **Global Library**
 with the **Edit** attribute.

See **Pipeline customization** Section to create a new **Task Type**.

[Pipeline customization](../customization-pipeline/README.md)


Once you have created your **Task Types**  on your **Global Library**, add them to your
**Production Library**, you will see the **Edit** displayed on the navigation drop-down menu.


![Navigation Edit](../img/getting-started/drop_down_menu_edit.png)


This new page behaves like the Asset and Shot global page. You can add your edits with the **+ New edit** button.

You can assign tasks, do the review, change status, etc.

You can add a metadata column, fill in the description, etc.

::: tip
Depending on your deliveries, you can also change the resolution per **Edit**.
:::

::: warning
The detail page is different from the other entities.

As **Edit** focuses on a specific long video, the detail page looks more like the comment detail page.
:::

You can **Rename** and **Delete** the Edit entity on this page, as you can for the Asset and shot entities.







## Create a Breakdown List

Filling out the breakdown helps you with the assembly of the Asset. With the
breakdown, you have all the details of the assets you need to add to create your
main Asset and we are sure we will omit nothing.

On the dropdown menu, choose **BREAKDOWN**.

![drop down Menu breakdown](../img/getting-started/drop_down_menu_breakdown.png)

On the left of the breakdown page is the asset menu (1); you can choose between those you created. They are the right part of
the screen; all the assets created are available for this production (3). Moreover, in
the middle section, your selection for the Asset (2).

![Breakdown page](../img/getting-started/breakdown_general_empty.png)

So now you have to select the Asset you want to cast.

You can display the assets as text if you don't have thumbnails yet or enlarge the
thumbnails size.


![Breakdown page text display](../img/getting-started/breakdown_text_display.png)

You may also realize an asset needs to be added to the list during your breakdown.

You can create a new asset directly from the breakdown page. Click the **+** on the right of the **All available assets**.

![Breakdown page create asset](../img/getting-started/breakdown_create_asset.png)


You can also select multiple assets at once. Click on the first Asset, hold the **shift** key, and click on the last Asset of your selection.

![Breakdown page global bulk select](../img/getting-started/breakdown_general_bulk_select.png)

Then click on the assets you want
to assign: characters, backgrounds, ... from the right part (3).
If you have selected multiple assets, your selection is applied to the numerous assets.

Copy an asset filled with assets and paste this asset selection into another asset.

You can see a **+1** or **+10** when you pass over the Asset. It's the number
of times you add this Asset, and you can click on it as many times as you need.

![Breakdown add asset](../img/getting-started/breakdown_add_asset.png)



You can now see the Asset in the middle of the screen (2). Next
to the Asset's name is the number of times it has been added. In this
example, we have added the character asset Llama two times.


If you add an asset twice by mistake, you must go to the screen's middle part to select assets for this shot (2). From there, click on
**-1**. When you finish this shot, go on with the other shots.
Your selection is automatically saved.

![Breakdown remove asset](../img/getting-started/breakdown_remove_asset.png)

If a new asset is created during the task, return to the asset
page (using the dropdown menu) and create the needed assets. The tasks previously created are applied immediately to these new
assets. However, you have to do the assignment, and then you can
continue with the breakdown.

Now, your **Breakdown** page should look like this.

![breakdown add asset bulk](../img/getting-started/breakdown_general_bulk_select_full.png)



::: details Create a Breakdown List from a CSV File
