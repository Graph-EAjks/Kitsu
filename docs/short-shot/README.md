:::

### Navigation

You will see the navigation dropdown menu on the right of the main menu icon.

![Presentation of the global page](../img/getting-started/presentation_global_header.png)


You can choose between Production. The name of the actual Production and page are always displayed.

You can use the dropdown menu to navigate from Production to Production (if you have several).

Once you have selected a production, the next dropdown menu will help you navigate through the different pages of this Production.


::: details Navigation details
The first section is about the tracking of your tasks
- Shots
- Sequence
- Edits (If you have created specific tasks)

The second section is more about the side of the Production
- Concepts
- Playlists
- News feed

The third section is about statistics
- Sequence Stats


The fourth section is related to Team Management
- Schedule
- Quotas

::: tip
You start with the asset page, but you can change your production homepage to other entities (see setting page)
:::

::: warning 
If you realize you need an extra level of navigation, such as **Episodes**, you need to change your production Type to a **TV Show**.

If, on the contrary, you realize you need the assets instead of the Only Shots, you need to switch your production type from Only Shots to Short.
:::

### Global Search, News, Notification and Documentation
You have the global search on the right of the navigation dropdown menu. It's a quick access search that will display the four first results. If you need more results and filtering options, see the **Entity Search** page.


The next icon ![News](../img/getting-started/canny.png) is a direct link to our news and feedback page. 

You can see all the new features with an animated gif and also add suggestions about the next feature you want to see in Kitsu.


Then, the bell shows you your notification (assignation, comments, tag)![Notification](../img/getting-started/notification_icon_on.png). The number of notifications unread will appear in the bell icon.



The last icon before your avatar is the documentation button.
![documentation button](../img/getting-started/documentation_button.png), that you are reading right now!


### Personal Settings
You can click on your avatar to open your menu (setting, documentation, etc.).

![Profile enlarged](../img/getting-started/profil_enlarge.png).

## The Tasks Spreadsheet

### Entitie spreadsheet

The second part of the screen is common to all the entities (asset, shot, sequence, Edit). This is the global tasks spreadsheet.

Here, you see the status, assignation, priority, etc, for each task.

::: tip
The first line and column header of the spreadsheet always appear at the top of the page, even if you scroll down.

You can also **Stick** other columns to keep them visible at all times.
:::

### Filters

The first element on the left is the filter box. You can type anything you want for simple filtering, sequence, asset type, etc.

If you need more advanced filtering, please use the filter builder button.

![Filter Builder](../img/getting-started/filter_builder.png)

You can then save all the filters and use them as your pages.

### Simplify the display

On the right part of the screen, there are some buttons (from left to right) to hide or display the assignation, hide or display the extra column, enlarge or reduce the thumbnail,
![display and Hide option](../img/getting-started/display_hide_option.png)


### Import / Export
batch import thumbnail ![batch import thumbnail](../img/getting-started/add_thumbnails.png), and finally import ![Import button](../img/getting-started/import.png) or export ![export button](../img/getting-started/export.png) data.



### Metadata column
Below, you have the name of the column. the (+) next to **Name** ![Add metadata column](../img/getting-started/add_column_custom.png) is here to create a new metadata column. Then, you have the name of the task type column.

### Customize the view
On the far right of the screen, next to the scroll bar, is the option to hide and display a text column

![Display/hide text column](../img/getting-started/visible_column_detail.png).


### Sum-up of your view
The last part (4), at the bottom of the screen, is the sum-up of your displayed page. It means the sum-up will update if you filter the page.

You can see the number of elements (assets or shots), the total number of estimated days, and the total number of days already spent.



## Create a Shot
### Create your first shot

It's time to create **shots** for your Production.

::: warning
Shots are linked to Sequences in Kitsu.
This means you need to first create a sequence and then populate this sequence with shots.
:::

You need to go to the **Shots** page: you can use the
dropdown menu and click on the **SHOTS**.

![Drop down menu shot](../img/getting-started/drop_down_menu_shot.png)

Click on the **Add shots** button to start with the shot creation.

![First add shots](../img/getting-started/new_shot.png)

::: warning
When you create a shot, the task workflow you have designed will be applied, and all the tasks will be created at the same time as the shot.
:::

A new pop-up opens for the creation of the shots.
You can now create the sequences and the shots.

Enter the first sequence, for instance, sq01,
then **add**. 

Now, you can see your sequence has been created. To add shots to this sequence, you need to select it and create your shots.

For example, type sh0010 on the shots column, then again **add**.
You can also define padding for your shots.

::: tip
If you want to name your shots ten on ten as SH0010, SH0020, SH0030, etc, set the **Shot Padding** as 10
:::

![Manage shots](../img/getting-started/manage_shot.png)

You can now see that new shots are listed and linked by their sequence.
You have created the first shot of the first sequence.

Now, let's add more shots than just one! As you can see, the box already contains your name
code but incremented, so you have to continue to click on **add** to
create more shots.

![Add shots](../img/getting-started/add_shots.png)

To add more sequences, go to the left part, type the name of your new sequence, and then click on **add**.
Your second sequence is selected, and you can now add shots.

::: tip
If a shot is misplaced on a sequence, you have to edit the shot
![Edit button](../img/getting-started/edit_button.png), and change the
sequence.
![edit shot Change sequence](../img/getting-started/edit_shot.png)

![Change sequence](../img/getting-started/change_seq.png)
:::


To delete a shot, see the FAQ : [How to delete a shot](../faq-deletion/README.md#how-to-delete-a-shot)

To delete a sequence, see the FAQ : [How to delete a Sequence](../faq-deletion/README.md#how-to-delete-a-sequence)




## Create Shots from an EDL File
You may already have your shots list ready in an **EDL** file.
With Kitsu, you can import your **EDL** file directly to create the sequence, shot, number of frames, Frame in and frame out, and more.

On the **Global Shot Page**, you will see an **Import EDL** button.

![Import EDL Button](../img/getting-started/import_edl_button.png)

You can select the naming convention of the video file used during the editing on the pop-up.

![Import EDL Menu](../img/getting-started/import_edl_menu.png)

It means the video clip on the editing is named as project_sequence_shot.extension.

Here is an example of an EDL for the LGC production.

![EDL Example](../img/getting-started/edl_example.png)

The video files are named  LGC_100-000.mov, which means LGC is the production name, 100 is the sequence name, and 000 is the shot name.

You can import the EDL file once you are set with the naming convention.

Then click on **Upload EDL**

Then Kitsu will create the shots.

![EDL Shot creation](../img/getting-started/edl_shot_creation.png)
:::

::: details Create Shots from a CSV Spreadsheet File
You may already have your shots list ready in a spreadsheet file.
With Kitsu, you have two ways to import them; the first is to import a `.csv` file directly, and the second is to copy-paste your data directly into Kitsu.

First, save your spreadsheet as a `.csv` file.

Then, return to the shot page on Kitsu and click the **Import** icon.
![Import Icon](../img/getting-started/import.png)

![Import data copy paste data](../img/getting-started/import_result_shot.png)
:::



## Add the number of Frames and Frame ranges to the shots

At this stage of the Production, the animatic should be done. This means you have
the length (**number of frames**, **Frame range In**, and **Frame range Out**) for each shot. You can
add this information to the spreadsheet. This way, you are sure that all
the frames are calculated and none are missing or over-computed.

::: warning
If you have created your shots and sequence by hand, 
the **Frame** column will be hidden. You must edit at least one shot and fill in the number of frames to display the **Frame** column.
The column will be displayed if you have created your shots and imported the number of frames with a CSV/spreadsheet.
:::



You need to edit the shots to fill in the frame range information. Click on the
edit button ![Edit button](../img/getting-started/edit_button.png) on the right
side of the shot line.

![edit shot Change sequence](../img/getting-started/edit_shot.png)

On the new window, you can enter the shots **In** and **Out**. Then, save by clicking the **Confirm** button.



![Shot edit page](../img/getting-started/shot_edit.png)

Now that you have unlocked the **Frames**, **In**, and **Out** columns, you can fill them
directly from the global shot page.

Click on the case you want to fill in and add the data.

::: tip
If you enter the **Frame In** and **Frame Out**, Kitsu automatically calculates the **Number of Frame**.
:::

![Shot edit page](../img/getting-started/shot_framerange_global_edit.png)


You can also use the **CSV Import** to update your frame range quickly.
 [Update Shots information with CSV Import](../batch-action/README.md#update-shots-information-with-csv-import)

You can also access the history of shot values.

![Shot framerange detail](../img/getting-started/shot_framerange_detail.png)

![Shot Values History](../img/getting-started/shot_values_history.png)


## Create Custom Metadata Columns

To add more information on the general spreadsheet pages, you must create a custom **metadata column**.

You may have extra information to add to your pages, such as the **level of difficulties**, **Weather**, **Tag**, etc. You can store all text (or number) information in the custom metadata column.


Click on the **+** near the Name column.

![Metadata Column](../img/getting-started/add_column_custom.png)



With the **Type** option, you can choose how you want to store your information:
- a free **Text**, 
- a **Number**, 
- a **Checkbox**, 
- a **List of value**,
- a **List of tags**,
- a **Checklist**.

![Metadata Column detail](../img/getting-started/custom_column_detail.png)

::: warning 
The **Text**, **Number**, and **Checkbox** allow you to add different information for each entity. You don't have to plan it first.

The **List of value**, **List of tags**, and **Checklist** give you the same choice for each entity. Moreover, it has to be filled now.

![Metadata Column list](../img/getting-started/custom_column_list.png)

Type the list elements below **Available values**, and confirm them by clicking on **Add value**.
:::

You can also link the **metadata column** to one or several **departments**.

::: tip

## Create a Sequence

In Kitsu, you can also track tasks at the **Sequence** Level.
It's especially useful when
you have macro tasks to track, like Story and color Board, Color Grading, etc.

Use the navigation menu to go to the **Sequences** page.

![Navigation Sequences](../img/getting-started/drop_down_menu_sequence_page.png)

::: warning
This new page behaves like the asset and shot global page.

To use this page, You first need to create dedicated task types on your **Global Library**
 with the **Sequence** attribute.

See **Pipeline customization** Section to create a new **Task Type**.

[Pipeline customization](../customization-pipeline/README.md)

Once you have created your **Task Types**  on your **Global Library**, add them to your
**Production Library** (setting page).
:::

Once your task types are ready on the settings page, you need to create a sequence (the same as the assets or shots).




This new page behaves like the asset and shot global page. You can add your edits with the **+ New Sequence** button.

You can assign tasks, do the review, change status, etc.

You can add a metadata column, fill in the description, etc.


::: tip
You can create a sequence directly from here (+New sequence button) or create a sequence linked to your shots from the global shot page.
:::


You can **Rename** and **Delete** the Sequence entity on this page, as for the asset and shot entity.

If you click on the name of a sequence, you will see the detail page of this sequence.

![Sequence detailed page](../img/getting-started/sequence_detail_page.png)

On the detailed page, you have access to the sequence casting.
You can see all the assets used in the whole sequence.

You can also access the schedule, Preview Files, Activity, and Timelog of the sequence **tasks**.



## Create an Edit

You can track tasks at the **Edit** Level in Kitsu.

It's especially useful when
You have several edits to track through several validation steps. For example, you can track your whole movie, several trailers, and the First Edit, Fine Edit, Mix, etc.

::: warning
Per default, the **Edit** page will not be displayed until you have task types for it on your **production library** (setting page)
:::



To use this page, you need to first create a dedicated task type on your **Global Library**
 with the **Edit** attribute.

See **Pipeline customization** Section to create a new **Task Type**.

[Pipeline customization](../customization-pipeline/README.md)


Once you have created your **Task Types**  on your **Global Library**, add them to your
**Production Library**, you will see the **Edit** displayed on the navigation drop-down menu.


![Navigation Edit](../img/getting-started/drop_down_menu_edit.png)


This new page behaves like the asset and shot global page. You can add your edits with the **+ New edit** button.

You can assign tasks, do the review, change status, etc.

You can add a metadata column, fill in the description, etc.

::: tip
Depending on your deliveries, you can also change the resolution per **Edit**.
:::

::: warning
The detail page is different from the other entities.

As **Edit** focuses on a specific long video, the detail page looks more like the comment detail page.
:::

You can **Rename** and **Delete** the Edit entity on this page for the asset and shot entity.
