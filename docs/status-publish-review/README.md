# Status, publish and review



## Publish a Concept

To publish a **Concept**, go to the **Concept** page with the navigation menu.

![Concept Menu](../img/getting-started/menu_concept.png)

To upload a concept, click the **Add a new reference to concepts** button.

You can upload one or several concepts at the same time.

![Concept empty page](../img/getting-started/concept_empty_prod.png)

Once you upload your previews, the concept page will look like this.

![Concept filled page](../img/getting-started/concept_filled_prod.png)


You can interact with the concept in two ways: click on the picture to see an enlarged view.
The second is to click on the status part to open the **Comment Panel** on the right.

You have two options on the comment panel: link a concept with an existing asset or delete the concept.
You can also comment and change the status of the asset.

The idea is to have one version per **Concept**. If it's not validated, you need to upload a new concept, not to have multiple versions of the same concept.

One concept is one task.


![Concept options](../img/getting-started/concept_options.png)


## Link a Concept to an Asset

Once concepts are uploaded, you can link them to the assets.

You can see the links on the status part of the assets.

Click on the status part of the concept; it will open the comment panel on the right.

![Concept Comment Panel](../img/getting-started/concept_comment_panel.png)

On the comment panel, you have two options on top of the panel: Link a concept to an asset and delete the concept.

To link an asset, click on the **Link** ![Link button](../img/getting-started/link_icon.png) button.

Kitsu will display all the **Assets** available to link with the concept uploaded.

On top of the comment panel, Kitsu will list the linked assets. For now, there are **No Links**.


![Concept link](../img/getting-started/concept_link.png)

To link an asset, you have to click on it. You will see the name of the assets linked on the top of the screen, but also under the preview of the concept.


![Concept asset linked](../img/getting-started/concept_asset_linked.png)

Once a concept is linked to an asset, you can see the concepts on the detail page of an asset.

Return to the asset page, and click on the asset name you want to see the concept.

![Detail asset page](../img/getting-started/asset_detail_page.png)

Per default, the casting detail is displayed on the second part of the screen. 
Use the dropdown menu to choose the concept.

![asset detail concept](../img/getting-started/asset_detail_concept.png)

Once in the concept section, you will see all the concepts created for this asset. You can filter them per status.

![asset detail concept list](../img/getting-started/asset_detail_concep_listt.png)



## Change Status and Add a Comment

To change the status of a task and write a comment, you need to click on the
status of the task.

![Shot status](../img/getting-started/shot_status.png)

It makes a panel appear on the right, and here, you can write a comment, change the status, and attach a file.

![Comment Panel](../img/getting-started/comment_panel.png)

The **Commen Panel** is split into 2 tabs :

The comment uses the **Markdown** language. If you need specific syntax, feel free to look at the markdown guide website: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/


On the **Leave a Comment...** section, you can **tag** someone on the team in the comments. Type the `@`and it opens a sub-menu with the list of the team.

![Tag someone](../img/getting-started/tag_team.png)

You can also **tag** a full department by typing '@' and the department's name.

![Tag department](../img/getting-started/tag_department.png)

You can add a **checklist** to your comments.

You need to click on the **Add checklist** button, and the first item of the checklist appears.

You can add one or several previews to any comments. It can be a picture (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`), a video (`.mp4`, `.mov`, `.wmv`),
or an `.glb` file. You can review all the previews from the browser or mix everything.

For the `.glb` file you can also review it as wireframe, or add a `.HDR` file to check the lighting.

# Playlists

## Create a Playlist


You can find the **Playlists** page on the drop-down menu.

- (2) The last created playlists and the last modified playlists

![Playlist page](../img/getting-started/playlist_page.png)

WFA short for the animation stage.
You have to type **animation=wfa** in the search bar. Valid your selection with the **Add selection** button.
Kitsu will select the shots that have the **WFA** status at the **Animation** stage, but Kitsu will automatically load **the latest uploaded version**.
