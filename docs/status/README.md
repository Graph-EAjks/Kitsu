# Statuses and Feedback

In Kitsu, statuses serve as indicators reflecting the current state or progress of a task. You can easily see the current status at a glance and add comments to update team members when a status changes.

## The Comment Panel

To change the status of a task and write a comment, click on the status of the task.

![Shot status](../img/getting-started/shot_status.png)

A panel will appear on the right where you can write a comment, change the status, and attach a file.

![Comment Panel](../img/getting-started/comment_panel.png)

The **Comment Panel** is split into two tabs:
- POST COMMENT
- PUBLISH REVISION

You can change the **Status**, from the **POST COMMENT** tab.

Comments support the use of **Markdown**, which is a markup language used for formatting plain text in a simple, readable way. It allows users to add basic formatting elements such as headings, lists, bold and italic text, links and much more. For specific syntax, you can refer to the markdown guide website: [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

### Tagging Team Members

You can also **tag** a team member in the comments to notify them directly. To do this, type `@`, which will open a submenu with a list of team members. Select the person you wish to notify, and upon submitting your comment, they will receive a notification.

You can also **tag** an entire department by typing '@' followed by the department's name.

### Adding Checklists

You can also add checklist items to keep track of miscellaneous items that don't warrant their own task. To add a **checklist** to your comments, click the **Add checklist** button. The first item of the checklist will appear.

Hit **Enter** or click the button again to add more checklist items, and give each one a name.

### Updating Multiple Statuses at Once
You can also change the status for multiple tasks at once.

Then, go to the action menu's **Change status** section.

## Artist Board Statuses
### Customizing Statuses Used on the Artist Board Page
When you assign a task to an artist, it will appear on their to-do page when they log in.

While the default view shows their tasks in a traditional list view, they can also choose to display their tasks in a board view. Each **Status** will be be represented by a column, and the assigned tasks will be cards that can be dragged from status to status as the tasks progress.

To customize the board view, go to the settings page of your production.

![Setting page](../img/getting-started/drop_down_menu_setting.png)

Then go to the Task Status tab. You will see a list of the statuses used in your production.

These statuses will be used as the columns on the board page. You can drag and move the statuses to change their order as they appear in the board view.

![Setting page status order](../img/getting-started/setting_status_order.png)

Next, click on the **Board Status** section.

![Setting page status board](../img/getting-started/setting_status_board.png)

Here you can customize which permission roles can see what statuses on their **Board** page. 

To access this view, select the **Board** tab from the **My Tasks** page. Your team will see a page that looks similar to this

::: tip
Customizing which statuses appear in the **Board** view is set per permission role. It cannot be customized on an individual user basis.
