## Change Status and Add a Comment

To change the status of a task and write a comment, you need to click on the
status of the task.

It makes a panel appear on the right, and here, you can write a comment, change the status, and attach a file.

The **Comment Panel** is split into two tabs : 
- POST COMMENT
- PUBLISH REVISION

To change the **Status**, stay in **POST COMMENT** tab.

The comment uses the **Markdown** language. If you need specific syntax, feel free to look at the markdown guide website: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/


On the **Leave a Comment...** section, you can **tag** someone on the team in the comments. Type the `@`and it opens a sub-menu with the list of the team.

![Metadata Column Sort By](../img/getting-started/custom_column_sortby.png)

The shots are not sorted by name but by the metadata column information.

You can also select in the menu if you want to edit the name of the metadata column and its information or if you want to delete it.

You can also use the **CSV Import** to quickly fill your custom metadata column.
First, you must create your **Metadata column** into Kitsu, add it to your spreadsheet, and copy-paste your data into the **CSV Import**.

## Select the status for the Artist board page

When you assign a task to an artist, they will see it on their to-do page when they log in.

But they can also choose to display their task as a board view. Each **Status** will be a column, and the assigned task is a card that can be moved from status to status depending on the task's progress.

To setup the board view, you need to go to the settings page of your production.

![Setting page](../img/getting-started/drop_down_menu_setting.png)

Then go to the Task Status tab. You will see a list of the statuses used in your production.

It will be the same status used as the column on the board page. You can drag and move the statuses to change their order as they appear on the board view.


![Setting page status order](../img/getting-started/setting_status_order.png)

The next step is with the **Board Status** page.

![Setting page status board](../img/getting-started/setting_status_board.png)

Depending on the permission, you can choose which status will be displayed on the **Board** page.

Once it's done, your artist should have a page like this.
