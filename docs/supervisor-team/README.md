# Manage your Department(s)

Now, it's time to focus on your team. The first thing to do is to assign tasks.


## Assign and Estimate Tasks to your Department
Your view is automatically filtered on the global shot/asset page as **My Department**. You only see your **Task Type** and the **Custom Columns** linked to your department.

When you assign one or several tasks to someone, you will notice that you only have access to the people from your department. 

It's faster for you to find the right Artist for the task.

Now that you have assigned all your Artists, it's time to fill in the **Estimation** for each task.

Click on the name of a **task Type** column to open its dedicated page.

On this page, you can access three tabs: **Tasks**, **Schedule**, and **Estimation**. We will focus on the last one.

The **Estimation** page is split into two parts. On the left, you have all the tasks sorted by Artist, their number of frames, and seconds.

On the right part of the screen, you have the sum-up of your team, one line per Artist. You will have the **Count** of the total number of assigned tasks, the total number of **Frames** and **Seconds**, and the updated total number of days **Estimated**.

With all this information, Kitsu can calculate different estimated **Quotas**: **per Second**, **per Frame**, and **per Task**.

You can now fill the **Estimation** column on the left and see the result on the right.

As soon as you fill in an **Estimation** for a task, you will see the artist line updated on the right part.

You know if the distribution of the tasks is fair between your team member and what are their estimated quotas for production. 

You need to do it according to their experience and the difficulty of each task.


## Supervise the Quotas of your Department

At the beginning of the production, while you set estimation for each task, you also define estimated quotas for each of your Artists.

Once a task is validated, the remaining line on the **Estimation** tab of the **Task Type** page will update and display the remaining number of tasks and the **updated estimated quotas**.

You can keep an eye your every member of your team and see if their **estimated quotas** stay on the line with the first established.

When you need to check on their **Actual Quotas**, you need to go to the **Quotas** page. 

![Quotas](../img/getting-started/supervisor_quotas.png)


Kitsu has two ways to calculate the quotas. The first is based on the daily timesheets filled out by the artists.

The calculation of the quotas will start as soon as the Artist fills out his first timesheet on this task, and it will end when he stops.


The second way is based on the status. The calculation starts with the **WIP** status and ends with the **WFA** status.

It's **First take** quotas, meaning that the back-and-forth of comments won't be entered in the calculation.

![Weekly Quotas](../img/getting-started/supervisor_quotas_week.png)


This page's most important element is the first column, **Average**. Kitsu will calculate the average quotas for each Artist per **Day**, **Week**, or **Month**.


## Supervise the Timesheets of your Department

As a Supervisor, you also have to keep an eye on your team's hours. The **Timesheet** page shows how many hours they do every day, week, and month.

It's time to notice a pattern of extra hours, sick days, or no vacation. It's also your job to take care of your team, speak with them, and see if everything is fine if they are not burning.
