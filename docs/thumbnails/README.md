# Add a Thumbnail
## Add a Thumbnail by hand

To define a preview as a thumbnail, the preview MUST have been uploaded as a revision. 

To publish a preview, picture, or video, select the **PUBLISH REVISION** tab on the comment panel of the task.

You can use the preview as a **thumbnail** on the asset or shot task. It
helps to recognize the assets/shots on the main pages.
On the list page, click on the status you want, then on the right panel, click the **Preview** button (1).

Once you have clicked on the button, you can choose if you want to pick the first or any frame; once the frame is selected, you see the thumbnail appear, and the button turns gray.
