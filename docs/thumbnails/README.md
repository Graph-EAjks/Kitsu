# Add a Thumbnail
## Add a Thumbnail by hand

To define a preview as a thumbnail, the preview MUST have been uploaded as a revision. 

To publish a preview, picture, or video, select the **PUBLISH REVISION** tab on the task's comment panel.

You can use the preview as a **thumbnail** on the asset or shot task. It
helps to recognize the assets/shots on the main pages.
On the list page, click on the status you want, then click the **Preview** button (1) on the right panel.

Once you click on the button, you can choose to pick the first or any frame; once the frame is selected, the thumbnail appears, and the button turns gray.

Don't forget to **Save**. Now, as soon as you upload a preview, it will be used automatically as a thumbnail.

## Batch Upload Previews (as Thumbnails)

You can use the **Add Thumbnails** button ![Add thumbnails button](../img/getting-started/add_thumbnails.png) on the global page to massively import thumbnails.

A new pop-up opens and asks you to choose which task types the thumbnails are linked to.

**Thumbnails batch import accepts image files and video files**.

Only the first frame is used as the thumbnail for the video files.

You have to name your thumbnails as sequence_shot.
