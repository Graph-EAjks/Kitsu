# Create a Video Game production

Now that you have designed your workflow in Kitsu, and invite more people, it's time to create your production. 

Click on the **Create a new
production** button.

![Create a production](../img/getting-started/create_production.png)

Enter your production name, and choose **short** as the **type**, then select the style of your production (2D, 3D).


Then, you have to fill in technical information, such as the number of FPS, the Ration, and the Resolution.

All these data will be used when Kitsu re-encodes the video previews uploaded.

Then, you need to define your production's start and end dates.

![Add a production](../img/getting-started/add_production.png)

In the next part, 3 to 6, you can define your production workflow.



You need to select your asset task type (3), map task type (4), task status (5), and asset types (6).

![Add a production Pipeline](../img/getting-started/add_production_pipe.png)


::: tip
To create your **Production Workflow**, you will select Task Types from the Global Library.

If you realize you missed some Task Types, you will be able to create them later.

## Create maps form an EDL File
You may already have your maps list ready in an **EDL** file.
With Kitsu, you can import directly your **EDL** file to create the level, map, number of frame, frame in and frame out.

On the **Global map Page** you have an **Import EDL** button.

![Import EDL Button](../img/getting-started/import_edl_button.png)

On the pop-up you can select the naming convention of the video file used during the editing.

![Import EDL Menu](../img/getting-started/import_edl_menu.png)

It means the video clip on the editing is named as project_level_map.extension.

Here is an example of an EDL for the LGC production.

![EDL Example](../img/getting-started/edl_example.png)

The video files are named  LGC_100-000.mov, it means LGC is the production name, 100 is the level name, and 000 is the map name.

Once you are set with the naming convention, you can import the edl file.

![map Values History](../img/getting-started/shot_values_history.png)


## Create Custom Metadata Columns

To add more information on the general spreadsheet pages, you must create a custom **metadata column**.

You may have extra information to add on your pages as the **level of difficulties**, **Weather**, **Tag**, etc. You can store all kinds of text (or number) information in the custom metadata column


Click on the **+** near the Name column.

![Metadata Column](../img/getting-started/add_column_custom.png)



With the **Type** option you can choose how you want to store your information:
- a free **Text**, 
- a **Number**, 
- a **Checkbox**, 
- a **List of value**,
- a **List of tags**,
- a **Checklist**.

![Metadata Column detail](../img/getting-started/custom_column_detail.png)

::: warning 
The **Text**, **Number**, and **Checkbox** allow you to add different information for each entity. You don't have to planned it first.

The **List of value**, **List of tags** and **Checklist** give you the same choice for each entity. Moreover, it has to be filled now.

![Metadata Column list](../img/getting-started/custom_column_list.png)

Type the list elements below **Available values**, and confirm them by clicking on **Add value**.
:::

You can also link the **metadata column** to one or several **departments**.

::: tip
If you link a metadata column to a department, the artists/supervisors will see it on their to-do page and department-filtered view.

You can link the metadata column to one or more departments. Click on the department from the list and then click on **add** to be effective.

Here VFX column is linked to two departements.

![Department metadata column filtered view](../img/getting-started/department_filtered_view_column.png)

:::

::: details Edit meta column
On the global page of the asset or the map, click on the arrow on the direct right of your metadata column, and click on **Edit**.

![Metadata column Edit](../img/getting-started/custom_column_edit.png)
:::


Back on the global spreadsheets page, you can fill in this information directly on the global page.
The cases are editable.

![Metadata Column detail](../img/getting-started/custom_column_list_edit.png)

::: tip
You can batch modify the metadata column by selecting on the left several entities, and then modify your metadata column.
:::

::: details Edit by hand
You can also modify the information with the edit button ![Edit button](../img/getting-started/edit_button.png).

You now see a new line on the edit pop-up. You can select the information from the list,
alternatively, enter the free text or number, check a box, or use the checklist, depending on your previous choice.

Remember to press the **Confirm** button when you are done.

![Metadata Column detail](../img/getting-started/edit_asset_custom.png)
:::

If you need to **edit** or **delete** the metadata column, go to the general spreadsheet page.
Nearby the name of your metadata column, click on the arrow ![Metadata Column detail](../img/getting-started/arrow.png).

::: tip
You can **sort** your global page with this new column. Click the arrow on the right of the column name to open his menu. Then click on **Sort By**.

You can also **Stick** the metadata column to the left
:::


## Create a level

In Kitsu, you can also track tasks at the **level** Level.
It's especially useful when
you have macro tasks to track, like Story and color Board, Color Grading, etc.

Use the navigation menu to go to the **levels** page.

![Navigation levels](../img/getting-started/drop_down_menu_sequence_page.png)

::: warning
This new page behaves like the asset and map global page.

To use this page, You first need to create dedicated task types on your **Global Library**
 with the **level** attribute.

See **Pipeline customization** Section to create a new **Task Type**.

[Pipeline customization](../customization-pipeline/README.md)

Once you have created your **Task Types**  on your **Global Library**, add them to your
**Production Library** (setting page).
:::

Once your have your task types ready in the setting page, you need then to create a level (same as the assets or maps).




This new page behaves like the asset and map global page. You can add your edits with the **+ New level** button.

You can assign tasks, do the review, change status etc.

You can add a metadata column, fill in the description, etc.


::: tip
You can create a level directly from here (+New level button), or you can create a level linked to your maps from the global map page.
:::


You can **Rename** and **Delete** the level entity on this page, as for the asset and map entity.

If you click on the name of a level, you will see the detail page of this level.

![level detailed page](../img/getting-started/sequence_detail_page.png)

On the detailed page, you have access to the casting of the level.
You can see all the assets used in the whole level.

You can also access the schedule, Preview Files, Activity, and Timelog of the level **tasks**.



## Create an Edit

You can track tasks at the **Edit** Level, in Kitsu.

It's especially useful when
you have several edits to track through several step of validation. For example you can track your whole movie and several trailers, and you track the First Edit, Fine edit, mix etc.

::: warning
Per default **Edit** page will not be displayed until you have task types for it on your **production library** (setting page)
:::



To use this page, you need to first create a dedicated task type on your **Global Library**
 with the **Edit** attribute.

See **Pipeline customization** Section to create a new **Task Type**.

[Pipeline customization](../customization-pipeline/README.md)


Once you have created your **Task Types**  on your **Global Library**, add them to your
**Production Library**, you will see the **Edit** displayed on the navigation drop-down menu.


![Navigation Edit](../img/getting-started/drop_down_menu_edit.png)


This new page behaves like the asset and map global page. You can add your edits with the **+ New edit** button.

You can assign tasks, do the review, change status etc.

You can add a metadata column, fill in the description, etc.

::: tip
You can also change the resolution per **Edit** depending on your deliveries.
:::

::: warning
The detail page is different from the other entities.

As **Edit** focus on a specific long video, the detail page looks more like the comment detail page
:::

You can **Rename** and **Delete** the Edit entity on this page as for the asset and map entity.







## Create a Breakdown List

Filling out the breakdown helps you with the assembly of the maps. With the
breakdown, you have all the details of the assets you need to add to create your
map, and we are sure to omit nothing.

On the dropdown menu, choose **BREAKDOWN**.

![drop down Menu breakdown](../img/getting-started/drop_down_menu_breakdown.png)

On the left of the breakdown page is the chapter/level/map menu (1); you can choose between those you created. They are the right part of
the screen; all the assets created are available for this production (main pack and chapters) (3). Moreover, in
the middle section, it is your selection for the map (2).

![Breakdown page](../img/getting-started/breakdown_general_empty.png)

So now you have to select the map you want to cast.

You can display the assets as text if you don't have thumbnails yet or enlarge the
thumbnails size.


![Breakdown page text display](../img/getting-started/breakdown_text_display.png)

You may also realize an asset needs to be added to the list during your breakdown.

You can create a new asset directly from the breakdown page. Click the **+** on the right of the **All available assets**.

![Breakdown page create asset](../img/getting-started/breakdown_create_asset.png)


You can also choose multiple maps at the same time. Click on the first map, hold the **shift** key, and click on the last map of your selection.

![Breakdown page global bulk select](../img/getting-started/breakdown_general_bulk_select.png)

Then click on the assets you want
to assign: characters, backgrounds, ... from the right part (3).
If you have selected multiple maps, your selection is applied to the numerous maps.

Copy a map filled with assets and paste this asset selection into another map.

You can see a **+1** or **+10** when you pass over the asset. It's the number
of times you add this asset, and you can click on it as many times as you need.

![Breakdown add asset](../img/getting-started/breakdown_add_asset.png)

You can also link all your assets to chapters on a TV show without specifying a level or map.

![Breakdown chapter asset](../img/getting-started/breakdown_episode.png)

This way, you can link all your assets to one or several chapters before the storyboard/animatic stage.

You can now see the asset in the middle of the screen (2). Next
to the asset's name is the number of times it has been added. In this
example, we have added the character asset Llama two times.


If you add an asset twice by mistake, you must go to the screen's middle part to select assets for this map (2). From there, click on
**-1**. When you finish this map, go on with the other maps.
Your selection is automatically saved.

![Breakdown remove asset](../img/getting-started/breakdown_remove_asset.png)

If a new asset is created during the storyboard, return to the asset
page (using the dropdown menu) and create the needed assets. The tasks previously created are applied immediately to these new
assets. However, you have to do the assignment, and then you can
continue with the breakdown.

Now, your **Breakdown** page should look like this.

![breakdown add asset bulk](../img/getting-started/breakdown_general_bulk_select_full.png)

You can also make a breakdown list for your assets if you need to assemble them and keep track of the separate parts.

On the top left corner of the screen, choose **asset** in the dropdown menu below **FOR**.

![Breakdown asset menu](../img/getting-started/breakdown_asset_menu.png)

You can now access a second dropdown menu to choose your asset type: **Character**, **Environment**, **Props**, **FX**, ...

![Breakdown asset type](../img/getting-started/breakdown_asset_menu_type.png)

You can fill the asset breakdown page the same way as the maps. First, select one or more assets on the left part and then add the right part's elements.

::: details Create a Breakdown List from a CSV File

You may already have your breakdown list ready in a spreadsheet file. With Kitsu, you have two ways to import it; the first is to import a .`csv` file directly, the second is to copy-paste your data directly into Kitsu.

First, save your spreadsheet as a `.csv` file following Kitsu's recommendation.

Click on the **import** button ![Import button](../img/getting-started/import.png)

A pop-up window **Import data from a CSV** opens, click on **Browse** to pick your `.csv` file.

![Breakdown import csv file](../img/getting-started/import_breakdown_csv_file.png)

To see the result, click on the **Preview** button.

You can check and adjust the name of the columns with the preview of your data.

NB: the **chapter** column is only mandatory for a **TV Show** production.

![Breakdown import Preview](../img/getting-started/import_breakdown_preview.png)

Once everything is good, click on the **Confirm** button to import your data into Kitsu.

Now, you have your breakdown imported into Kitsu.

![Breakdown import Preview](../img/getting-started/breakdown_general_bulk_select_full.png)
:::

::: details Create a Breakdown List by Copy / Pasting a Spreadsheet File

Open your spreadsheet, select your data and copy them.

![Import copy data](../img/getting-started/import_copypas_breakdown.png)

Then, go back to the breakdown page on Kitsu, and click on the **Import** icon 
![Import Icon](../img/getting-started/import.png).

A pop-up window **Import data from a CSV** opens, click on the **Paste a CSV data** tab.

![Import data copy paste tab](../img/getting-started//import_breakdown_csv_file.png)
 
You can paste your previously selected data and see the result with the **Preview** button.
 
![Import data copy paste data](../img/getting-started/import_breakdown_preview.png)
  
You can check and adjust the name of the columns with the preview of your data.
 
NB: the **chapter** column is only mandatory for a **TV Show** production.
 
![Import data copy paste data](../img/getting-started/import_breakdown_preview.png)

Once everything is good, click on the **Confirm** button to import your data into Kitsu.

Now, you have all your assets imported into Kitsu.

## Introduction to Asset State: Ready For

Most of the time, you don't need to wait for all the tasks of an asset to be validated to use it on a map task.

For example, when an asset is validated at the **Concept** stage, it can be used for the **Storyboard** stage.
Then, when it's validated at the **Modeling** stage, you can use it for the **Layout** stage and so on.

That's exactly what the asset state **Ready For** is doing, let you know the state of the tasks of an asset compare it's usability for the map tasks.

Now that we have filled our breakdown, we know exactly which asset is used on every map.

First we need to define the state of an asset compare to it's task status. You can modify the **Ready for** by click on a cell, you will see a dropdown menu with the map task.

![Asset Status](../img/getting-started/asset_status.png)

::: tip
You can use the **automations** to do the heavy lifting for you.

You can set automation with the **ready for** trigger. 
:::

Now that we have change some asset state **Ready for**, we can see the result in the map page.

You can notice that some of the white box are now **Green**: all the assets cast in this map are ready for this specific task.

![Asset Status](../img/getting-started/asset_status_box.png)

If you see the white box, Kitsu will display how many assets are ready for this task.

![Asset Status](../img/getting-started/asset_status_empty.png)

 ::: tip
If you don't see any boxes, it means no assets are casted for this map.
:::
 
Then, you can click on the map's name to go to its detail page.
Then, you will see all the assets cast in this map and their status.

![Asset Status](../img/getting-started/asset_status_detail.png)

It's the fastest way to know if you can start a map for a specific task.
