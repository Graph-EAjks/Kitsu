# Create a Video Game Production

Now that you have designed your workflow in Kitsu and invited more people, it's time to create your production. 

Click on the **Create a new
production** button.

![Create a production](../img/getting-started/create_production.png)

Enter your production name, choose **short** as the **type**, and then select your production style (2D, 3D).


Then, you must fill in technical information, such as the number of FPS, the Ration, and the Resolution.

All these data will be used when Kitsu re-encodes the video previews uploaded.

Then, you need to define your production's start and end dates.

![Add a production](../img/getting-started/add_production.png)

You can define your production workflow in the next part, 3 to 6.



You need to select your asset task type (3), map task type (4), task status (5), and asset types (6).

![Add a production Pipeline](../img/getting-started/add_production_pipe.png)


::: tip
To create your **Production Workflow**, you will select Task Types from the Global Library.

If you realize you missed some Task Types, you can create them later.

See the [Studio Workflow](../first_production/README_configure_Kitsu.md#studio-workflow) section.
:::

Then, 7 and 8 are the option parts. If you already have a spreadsheet with your asset/map.

See the **import CSV** section for more details.

[Import asset](../batch-action/README.md#create-assets-from-a-csv-spreadsheet-file)

[Import map](../batch-action/README.md#create-shots-from-a-csv-spreadsheet-file)

Validate everything with the ![All done](../img/getting-started/all_done_go.png) button.






## Introduction to Kitsu global Page



Welcome to Kitsu's global asset page.

Let's take a look around.

:::

### Navigation

You will see the navigation dropdown menu on the right of the main menu icon.

![Presentation of the global page](../img/getting-started/presentation_global_header.png)


You can choose between production. The name of the actual production and actual page are always displayed.

You can use the dropdown menu to navigate from production to production (if you have several).

Once you have selected a production, the next dropdown menu will help you navigate through the different pages of this production.


::: details Navigation details
The first section is about the tracking of your tasks
- Assets
- maps
- level
- Edits (If you have created specific tasks)

The second section is more about the side of the production
- Concepts
- Breakdown
- Playlists
- News feed

The third section is about statistics
- level Stats
- Asset Type Stats

The fourth section is related to Team Management
- Schedule
- Quotas

::: tip
You start with the asset page, but you can change your production homepage to other entities (see setting page)
:::

::: warning 
If you realize you need an extra level of navigation as **chapters**, You need to change your production Type to a **TV Show**.

If, on the contrary, you realize you don't need the **assets** or the **maps**, you need to switch your production type to **Only Assets** or **Only Maps**.
:::

### Global Search, News, Notification and Documentation
You have the global search on the right of the navigation dropdown menu. It's a quick access search that will display the four first results. If you need more results and filtering options, see the **Entity Search** page.


The next icon ![News](../img/getting-started/canny.png) is a direct link to our news and feedback page. 

You can see all the new features with an animated gif and also add suggestions about the next feature you want to see in Kitsu.


Then, the bell shows you your notification (assignation, comments, tag)![Notification](../img/getting-started/notification_icon_on.png). The number of notifications unread will appear in the bell icon.



The last icon before your avatar is the documentation button.
![documentation button](../img/getting-started/documentation_button.png), that you are reading right now!


### Personal Settings
You can click on your avatar to open your menu (setting, documentation, etc.).

![Profile enlarged](../img/getting-started/profil_enlarge.png).

## The Tasks Spreadsheet

### Entity spreadsheet

The second part of the screen is common to all the entities (asset, map, level, Edit). This is the global tasks spreadsheet.

Here, you see the status, assignation, priority, etc, for each task.

::: tip
The first line and column header of the spreadsheet always appear at the top of the page, even if you scroll down.

You can also **Stick** other columns to keep them visible at all times.
:::

### Filters

The first element on the left is the filter box. For simple filtering, you can type anything you want, such as level, asset type, etc.

If you need more advanced filtering, please use the filter builder button.

![Filter Builder](../img/getting-started/filter_builder.png)

You can then save all the filters and use them as your pages.

### Simplify the display

On the right part of the screen, there are some buttons (from left to right) to hide or display the assignation, hide or display the extra column, enlarge or reduce the thumbnail,
![display and Hide option](../img/getting-started/display_hide_option.png)


### Import / Export
batch import thumbnail ![batch import thumbnail](../img/getting-started/add_thumbnails.png), and finally import ![Import button](../img/getting-started/import.png) or export ![export button](../img/getting-started/export.png) data.



### Metadata column
Below, you have the name of the column. the (+) next to **Name** ![Add metadata column](../img/getting-started/add_column_custom.png) is here to create a new metadata column. Then, you have the name of the task type column.

### Customize the view
On the far right of the screen, next to the scroll bar, is the option to hide and display a text column

![Display/hide text column](../img/getting-started/visible_column_detail.png).


### Sum-up of your view
The last part (4), at the bottom of the screen, is the sum-up of your displayed page. It means the sum-up will update if you filter the page.

You can see the number of elements (assets or maps), the total number of estimated days, and the total number of days already spent.



## Create an Asset
### Create your first asset
So, now that we have created our production and have a general grasp of the Kitsu interface, it's time to create our very first asset.

On the asset page, click on **Add assets**.

![Asset page first time](../img/getting-started/add_assets_first.png)

::: warning
When you create an asset, your task workflow will be applied, and **all the tasks will be created simultaneously as the asset**.
:::

A pop-up window opens:

It asks you to choose the **Asset Type** (1).
If you didn't add a new asset type, Kitsu will provide you with examples such as Characters, Environment, FX, Props, etc. 
Let's start with a character.

::: tip
You can also customize the asset type list and the tasks pipeline.
[Customization of the workflow](../customization-pipeline/README.md#modify-an-existing-asset-types) )
:::

We give it a **Name** (2) and enter a description that helps the Artist know what to do and quickly identify the asset.

Click on **Confirm and stay** if you have multiple assets to create.


![Create an asset](../img/getting-started/add_asset_popup.png)

You can change the asset type and keep adding assets.

::: tip
The newly created asset appears in the background whenever you click on **Confirm and stay**.

### Upload a Concept

To create a **Concept**, go to the **Concept** page with the navigation menu.

![Concept Menu](../img/getting-started/menu_concept.png)

To upload a concept, click the **Add a new reference to concepts** button.

You can upload one or several concepts at the same time.

![Concept empty page](../img/getting-started/concept_empty_prod.png)

Once you upload your previews, the concept page will look like this.

![Concept filled page](../img/getting-started/concept_filled_prod.png)


You can interact with the concept in two ways: click on the picture to see an enlarged view.
The second is to click on the status part to open the **Comment Panel** on the right.

On the comment panel, you have two options: link a concept to an existing asset or delete it.
You can also comment and change the status of the asset.

The idea is to have one version per **Concept**. If it's not approved, you need to upload a new concept, not to have multiple versions of the same concept.

One concept is one task.


![Concept options](../img/getting-started/concept_options.png)


### Link a Concept to an Asset

Once concepts are uploaded, you can link them to the assets.

You can see the links on the status part of the assets.

Click on the status part of the concept; it will open the comment panel on the right.

![Concept Comment Panel](../img/getting-started/concept_comment_panel.png)

On the comment panel, you have two options at the top: Link a concept to an asset and delete the concept.

To link an asset, click on the **Link** ![Link button](../img/getting-started/link_icon.png) button.

Kitsu will display all the **Assets** available to link with the concept uploaded.

Kitsu will list the linked assets at the top of the comment panel. For now, there are No Links.


![Concept link](../img/getting-started/concept_link.png)

To link an asset, you have to click on it. The name of the linked assets will appear at the top of the screen but also under the preview of the concept.


![Concept asset linked](../img/getting-started/concept_asset_linked.png)

Once a concept is linked to an asset, it can be seen on the asset's detail page.

Return to the asset page, and click on the asset name you want to see the concept.

![Detail asset page](../img/getting-started/asset_detail_page.png)

Per default, the casting detail is displayed on the second part of the screen. 
Use the dropdown menu to choose the concept.

![asset detail concept](../img/getting-started/asset_detail_concept.png)

Once in the concept section, you will see all the concepts created for this asset. You can filter them per status.

![asset detail concept list](../img/getting-started/asset_detail_concep_listt.png)


## Create a map
### Create your first map

It's time to create **maps** for your production.

::: Warning
maps are linked to levels in Kitsu.
This means you need to first create a level and then populate this level with maps.
:::

You need to go to the **maps** page: you can use the
dropdown menu and click on the **mapS**.

![Drop down menu map](../img/getting-started/drop_down_menu_shot.png)

Click on the **Add maps** button to start with the map creation.

![First add maps](../img/getting-started/new_shot.png)

::: warning
When you create a map, the task workflow you have designed will be applied, and all the tasks will be created at the same time as the map.
:::

A new pop-up opens for the creation of the maps.
You can now create the levels and the maps.

Enter the first level, for instance, sq01,
then **add**. 

Now, you can see your level has been created. You need to select the maps you want to add to this level and create them.

For example, type sh0010 on the maps column, then again **add**.
You can also define Padding for your maps.

::: tip
If you want to name your maps ten on ten as SH0010, SH0020, SH0030, etc, set the **map Padding** as 10
:::

![Manage maps](../img/getting-started/manage_shot.png)

You can now see that new maps are listed and linked by their level.
You have created the first map of the first level.

Now, let's add more maps than just one! As you can see, the box already contains your name
code but incremented, so you have to continue to click on **add** to
create more maps.

![Add maps](../img/getting-started/add_shots.png)

To add more levels, go to the left part, type the name of your new level, and then click on **add**.
Your second level is selected, and you can now add maps.

::: tip
If a map is misplaced on a level, you have to edit the map
![Edit button](../img/getting-started/edit_button.png), and change the
level.
![edit map Change level](../img/getting-started/edit_shot.png)

## Create maps from an EDL File
You may already have your maps list ready in an **EDL** file.
With Kitsu, you can directly import your **EDL** file to create the level, map, and several frames, Frame in and frame out.

On the **Global map Page**, you will see an **Import EDL** button.

![Import EDL Button](../img/getting-started/import_edl_button.png)

You can select the naming convention of the video file used during the editing on the pop-up.

![Import EDL Menu](../img/getting-started/import_edl_menu.png)

It means the video clip on the editing is named as project_level_map.extension.

Here is an example of an EDL for the LGC production.

![EDL Example](../img/getting-started/edl_example.png)

The video files are named  LGC_100-000.mov, which means LGC is the production name, 100 is the level name, and 000 is the map name.

Once you are set with the naming convention, you can import the EDL file.

Then click on **Upload EDL**

Then, Kitsu will create the maps.

## Add the number of Frames and Frame ranges to the maps

At this stage of the production, the animatic should be done. This means you have
the length (**number of frames**, **Frame range In**, and **Frame range Out**) for each map. You can
add this information to the spreadsheet. This way, you are sure that all
the frames are calculated and none are missing or over-computed.

::: warning

![map Values History](../img/getting-started/shot_values_history.png)


## Create Custom Metadata Columns

To add more information on the general spreadsheet pages, you must create a custom **metadata column**.

You may have extra information to add to your pages, such as the **level of difficulties**, **Weather**, **Tag**, etc. You can store all text (or number) information in the custom metadata column.


Click on the **+** near the Name column.

![Metadata Column](../img/getting-started/add_column_custom.png)



With the **Type** option, you can choose how you want to store your information:
- a free **Text**, 
- a **Number**, 
- a **Checkbox**, 
- a **List of value**,
- a **List of tags**,
- a **Checklist**.

![Metadata Column detail](../img/getting-started/custom_column_detail.png)

::: warning 
The **Text**, **Number**, and **Checkbox** allow you to add different information for each entity. You don't have to plan it first.

The **List of value**, **List of tags**, and **Checklist** give you the same choice for each entity. Moreover, it has to be filled now.

![Metadata Column list](../img/getting-started/custom_column_list.png)

Type the list elements below **Available values**, and confirm them by clicking on **Add value**.
:::

You can also link the **metadata column** to one or several **departments**.

::: tip
Link a metadata column to a department. The artists/supervisors will see it on their to-do page and in the department-filtered view.

You can link the metadata column to one or more departments. Click on the department from the list and then click on **add** to be effective.

Here, the VFX column is linked to two departments.

![Department metadata column filtered view](../img/getting-started/department_filtered_view_column.png)

:::

::: details Edit meta column
On the asset's global page or the map, click on the arrow to the right of your metadata column and click on **Edit**.

![Metadata column Edit](../img/getting-started/custom_column_edit.png)
:::


You can fill in this information directly on the global spreadsheets page.
The cases are editable.

![Metadata Column detail](../img/getting-started/custom_column_list_edit.png)

::: tip
You can batch-modify the metadata column by selecting several entities on the left and then modifying your metadata column.
:::

::: details Edit by hand
You can also modify the information with the edit button ![Edit button](../img/getting-started/edit_button.png).

You now see a new line on the edit pop-up. You can select the information from the list,
alternatively, enter the free text or number, check a box, or use the checklist, depending on your previous choice.

Remember to press the **Confirm** button when you are done.

![Metadata Column detail](../img/getting-started/edit_asset_custom.png)
:::

Go to the general spreadsheet page if you need to edit or delete the metadata column.
Nearby the name of your metadata column, click on the arrow ![Metadata Column detail](../img/getting-started/arrow.png).

::: tip
You can **sort** your global page with this new column. Click the arrow on the right of the column name to open his menu. Then click on **Sort By**.

You can also **Stick** the metadata column to the left.
:::


## Create a level

In Kitsu, you can also track tasks at the **level** Level.
It's especially useful when
you have macro tasks to track, like Story and color Board, Color Grading, etc.

Use the navigation menu to go to the **levels** page.

![Navigation levels](../img/getting-started/drop_down_menu_sequence_page.png)

::: warning
This new page behaves like the asset and map global page.

To use this page, You first need to create dedicated task types on your **Global Library**
 with the **level** attribute.

See **Pipeline customization** Section to create a new **Task Type**.

[Pipeline customization](../customization-pipeline/README.md)

Once you have created your **Task Types**  on your **Global Library**, add them to your
**Production Library** (setting page).
:::

Once your task types are ready on the settings page, you need to create a level (the same as the assets or maps).




This new page behaves like the asset and map global page. You can add your edits with the **+ New level** button.

You can assign tasks, do the review, change status, etc.

You can add a metadata column, fill in the description, etc.


::: tip
You can create a level directly from here (+New level button) or create a level linked to your maps from the global map page.
:::


On this page, you can **Rename** and **Delete** the level entity, as well as the asset and map entity.

If you click on the name of a level, you will see the details page for this level.

![level detailed page](../img/getting-started/sequence_detail_page.png)

On the detailed page, you can access the casting of the level.
You can see all the assets used at the entire level.

You can also access the schedule, Preview Files, Activity, and Timelog of the level **tasks**.



## Create an Edit

You can track tasks at the **Edit** Level in Kitsu.

It's especially useful when
You have several edits to track through several validation steps. For example, you can track your whole movie, several trailers, and the First Edit, Fine Edit, Mix, etc.

::: warning
Per default, the **Edit** page will not be displayed until you have task types for it on your **production library** (setting page)
:::



To use this page, you need to first create a dedicated task type on your **Global Library**
 with the **Edit** attribute.

See **Pipeline customization** Section to create a new **Task Type**.

[Pipeline customization](../customization-pipeline/README.md)


Once you have created your **Task Types**  on your **Global Library**, add them to your
**Production Library**, you will see the **Edit** displayed on the navigation drop-down menu.


![Navigation Edit](../img/getting-started/drop_down_menu_edit.png)


This new page behaves like the asset and map global page. You can add your edits with the **+ New edit** button.

You can assign tasks, do the review, change status, etc.

You can add a metadata column, fill in the description, etc.

::: tip
Depending on your deliveries, you can also change the resolution per **Edit**.
:::

::: warning
The detail page is different from the other entities.

As **Edit** focuses on a specific long video, the detail page looks more like the comment detail page.
:::

You can **Rename** and **Delete** the Edit entity on this page, as you can for the asset and map entities.







## Create a Breakdown List

Filling out the breakdown helps you with the assembly of the maps. With the
breakdown, you have all the details of the assets you need to add to create your
map, and we are sure to omit nothing.

On the dropdown menu, choose **BREAKDOWN**.

![drop down Menu breakdown](../img/getting-started/drop_down_menu_breakdown.png)

On the left of the breakdown page is the chapter/level/map menu (1); you can choose between those you created. They are the right part of
the screen; all the assets created are available for this production (main pack and chapters) (3). Moreover, in
the middle section, it is your selection for the map (2).

![Breakdown page](../img/getting-started/breakdown_general_empty.png)

So now you have to select the map you want to cast.

You can display the assets as text if you don't have thumbnails yet or enlarge the
thumbnails size.


![Breakdown page text display](../img/getting-started/breakdown_text_display.png)

You may also realize an asset needs to be added to the list during your breakdown.

You can create a new asset directly from the breakdown page. Click the **+** on the right of the **All available assets**.

![Breakdown page create asset](../img/getting-started/breakdown_create_asset.png)


You can also select multiple maps at once. Click on the first map, hold the **shift** key, and click on the last map of your selection.

![Breakdown page global bulk select](../img/getting-started/breakdown_general_bulk_select.png)

Then click on the assets you want
to assign: characters, backgrounds, ... from the right part (3).
If you have selected multiple maps, your selection is applied to the numerous maps.

Copy a map filled with assets and paste this asset selection into another map.

You can see a **+1** or **+10** when you pass over the asset. It's the number
of times you add this asset, and you can click on it as many times as you need.

![Breakdown add asset](../img/getting-started/breakdown_add_asset.png)

You can also link all your assets to chapters on a TV show without specifying a level or map.

![Breakdown chapter asset](../img/getting-started/breakdown_episode.png)

This way, you can link all your assets to one or several chapters before the storyboard/animatic stage.

You can now see the asset in the middle of the screen (2). Next
to the asset's name is the number of times it has been added. In this
example, we have added the character asset Llama two times.


If you add an asset twice by mistake, you must go to the screen's middle part to select assets for this map (2). From there, click on
**-1**. When you finish this map, go on with the other maps.
Your selection is automatically saved.

![Breakdown remove asset](../img/getting-started/breakdown_remove_asset.png)

If a new asset is created during the storyboard, return to the asset
page (using the dropdown menu) and create the needed assets. The tasks previously created are applied immediately to these new
assets. However, you have to do the assignment, and then you can
continue with the breakdown.

Now, your **Breakdown** page should look like this.

![breakdown add asset bulk](../img/getting-started/breakdown_general_bulk_select_full.png)

You can also make a breakdown list for your assets if you need to assemble them and keep track of the separate parts.

On the top left corner of the screen, choose **asset** in the dropdown menu below **FOR**.

![Breakdown asset menu](../img/getting-started/breakdown_asset_menu.png)

You can now access a second dropdown menu to choose your asset type: **Character**, **Environment**, **Props**, **FX**, ...

![Breakdown asset type](../img/getting-started/breakdown_asset_menu_type.png)

You can complete the asset breakdown page the same way you would the maps. First, select one or more assets on the left part and then add the right part's elements.

::: details Create a Breakdown List from a CSV File

You may already have your breakdown list ready in a spreadsheet file. With Kitsu, you have two ways to import it: the first is to import a .csv file directly, and the second is to copy-paste your data directly into Kitsu.

First, save your spreadsheet as a `.csv` file following Kitsu's recommendation.

Click on the **import** button ![Import button](../img/getting-started/import.png)

A pop-up window **Import data from a CSV** opens. Click on **Browse** to pick your `.csv` file.

![Breakdown import csv file](../img/getting-started/import_breakdown_csv_file.png)

To see the result, click on the **Preview** button.

You can check and adjust the name of the columns by previewing your data.

NB: the **chapter** column is only mandatory for a **TV Show** production.

![Breakdown import Preview](../img/getting-started/import_breakdown_preview.png)

Once everything is good, click the **Confirm** button to import your data into Kitsu.

Now, you have your breakdown imported into Kitsu.

![Breakdown import Preview](../img/getting-started/breakdown_general_bulk_select_full.png)
:::

::: details Create a Breakdown List by Copying / Pasting a Spreadsheet File

Open your spreadsheet, select your data, and copy them.

![Import copy data](../img/getting-started/import_copypas_breakdown.png)

Then, go back to the breakdown page on Kitsu and click on the **Import** icon 
![Import Icon](../img/getting-started/import.png).

A pop-up window **Import data from a CSV** opens; click on the **Paste a CSV data** tab.

![Import data copy paste tab](../img/getting-started//import_breakdown_csv_file.png)
 
You can paste your previously selected data and see the result with the **Preview** button.
 
![Import data copy paste data](../img/getting-started/import_breakdown_preview.png)
  
You can check and adjust the name of the columns by previewing your data.
 
NB: the **chapter** column is only mandatory for a **TV Show** production.
 
![Import data copy paste data](../img/getting-started/import_breakdown_preview.png)

Once everything is good, click the **Confirm** button to import your data into Kitsu.

Now, all your assets have been imported into Kitsu.

## Introduction to Asset State: Ready For

Most of the time, you don't need to wait for an asset's tasks to be approved to use it on a map task.

For example, when an asset is approved at the **Concept** stage, it can be used for the **Storyboard** stage.
Then, when it's approved at the **Modeling** stage, you can use it for the **Layout** stage and so on.

That's exactly what the asset state **Ready For** is doing: let you know the state of the tasks of an asset and compare its usability for the map tasks.

Now that we have filled out our breakdown, we know exactly which asset is used on every map.

First, we need to define an asset's state relative to its task status. You can modify the **Ready for** by clicking on a cell. You will see a dropdown menu with the map task.

![Asset Status](../img/getting-started/asset_status.png)

::: tip
You can use the **automations** to do the heavy lifting.

You can set automation with the **ready for** trigger. 
:::

Now that we have changed some asset states to **Ready for**, we can see the result on the map page.

You can notice that some white boxes are now **Green**: all the assets in this map are ready for this specific task.

![Asset Status](../img/getting-started/asset_status_box.png)

If you see the white box, Kitsu will display how many assets are ready for this task.

![Asset Status](../img/getting-started/asset_status_empty.png)

 ::: tip
If you don't see any boxes, no assets are cast for this map.
:::
 
Then, you can click on the map's name to go to its detail page.
Then, you will see all the assets cast in this map and their status.

![Asset Status](../img/getting-started/asset_status_detail.png)

It's the fastest way to know if you can start a map for a specific task.
